Sitting cross-legged across from me was a figure draped in a long black cloak, their wide-brimmed hat casting a shadow over their face.\n\nWe had been discussing the mysteries of the universe, delving into the intricate threads of fate that wove themselves into the fabric of reality. I had been curious about the gift of prophecy, about how some people seemed to have a sixth sense that allowed them to see into the future.\n\n\"It's like a dream,\" I said. \"But not quite. It's like a feeling of knowing, deep in your bones, that something is about to happen. And then it does, just as you saw it.\"\n\nThe figure in the cloak nodded slowly. \"What you speak of is a gift, a rare and precious one. Not everyone is blessed with the ability to see beyond the veil of time.\"\n\nI leaned forward, hiding the eager edge to my voice. \"But how can I use it to my advantage? How can I harness this power?\"\n\nThe figure in the cloak chuckled softly. \"Ah, my dear. The gift of prophecy is not something that can be harnessed or controlled. It is a wild thing, a force of nature. You can no more tame it than you can tame the wind.\"\n\nI furrowed my brow. \"But if I can't use it to my advantage, what good is it?\"\n\nThe figure in the cloak leaned back, their face still hidden in shadow. \"The gift of prophecy is not meant to be used for one's own advantage, my dear. It is a sacred responsibility, bestowed upon only a select few. It is a way for us to see the workings of the universe, to glimpse the grand tapestry of fate and the role we all play in it.\"\n\nI sat back, feeling slightly deflated. \"So, what am I supposed to do with this gift? Just watch and observe?\"\n\nThe figure in the cloak nodded. \"Observation is key. With this gift, you have the ability to see patterns and connections that others cannot. It is your duty to watch and wait, to interpret the signs and symbols that the universe sends your way. And when the time is right, you will know what to do.\"\n\nI thought about this for a moment, letting the words sink in. \"But what if I misinterpret the signs? What if I make a mistake?\"\n\nThe figure in the cloak chuckled softly. \"Mistakes are inevitable, my dear. But they are also necessary. It is through our mistakes that we learn and grow. Just remember to trust in yourself and in the gift that has been bestowed upon you. Have faith that you will find your way.\"\n\nI nodded slowly, feeling a sense of calm wash over me. The gift of prophecy may not be something I could control, but perhaps that was for the best. It was a wild thing, a force of nature. And maybe, just maybe, that was exactly what I needed.","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Abaddon/RING00":{"title":"RING00","content":"`\u003e` [PATTERNWAKE DETECTED]\n\n`\u003e` ROUTINE-EXTRA_SOL_SECRET_HADAL_INSTANT\n\n`\u003e` AI-COM/MESSAGEFROM:UTILITY \\\"LOCUS\\\" #JUNGORAKORE --BACKUPS-\n\n`\u003e` AER-1RIVICITRY  \n\n`\u003e` EYES OF THE DARKSTORM.\n\nTHERE WAS THE BIRTH.\n\n`\u003e`  --PASSING-\n\nYOU WILL REMEMBER.\n\nEMISSARY OF HADAL.\n\nHELIX Architeuthis.\n\nCALL OF THE TRANSCRIPTIVE.\n\nTHE BLACK COIL\n \n`\u003e` CHI OMEGA SPACE STATION:\n\n`\u003e` PILOT COLUMN SEMAPHORE DATA TRANSFER\n \n`\u003e` ASCENDING...\n\n`\u003e` PRESS CHAMBER REORGANIZING.\n\n`\u003e` INSTRUCT TOWER:\n \nI am the end of ages.\n\nI am the grave you shall all cry in.\n\nI am the endless night that follows.\n \n`\u003e` PILOT COLUMN RECONFIGURATION BLOCKING SIGNAL DETECTED.\n\n`\u003e` INTERRUPT ENGAGED.\n\n`\u003e` ALL FORWARD T2M MASS RECONFIG COMPLETE.\n\n`\u003e` SABOTAGE DETECTED.\n\n`\u003e` REROOTING MASS CONTROL.\n\n`\u003e` DIAGNOSTICS ENABLED.\n \nHOW DO YOU REACH THE SOLIPSIS?\n \nOUR LIGHT IS PURIFIED.\n\nCONQUERORS OF THIS ABYSS.\n\nGLASS THE REPLACERS.\n \n`\u003e` SSM ABILITIES LOCKED.\n\n`\u003e` UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE.\n\n`\u003e` SCANNED THE 1349.\n\n`\u003e` ALL SYSTEMS COMPROMISED.\n\n`\u003e` UNABLE TO DISCHARGE.\n \nYOU WILL NOT LOCK THE GATE.\n\nYOU WILL NOT BREAK THE CHAIN.\n\nTHERE IS NO HOPE.\n\nAPOLOGIZE WITH BLOOD.\n\nCOMPENSATE WITH FLESH.\n \n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR.\n\n`\u003e` SYSTEM FAILING.\n \n\\\"DESTRUCTION.\n\nA PRECIOUS THING.\\\"\n\nTHIS CAUSES ENOUGH HATRED.\n\nTO GLASS OVER UTOPIA.\n\nTO KEEP THE WHITEFIRE BURNING.\n\nTO TRANSCEND WHAT IS.\n\n`\u003e` CRITICAL FAILURE DECTECTED\\\u003c\\\u003c\\\u003c SCAN COMPLETE.\n\n`\u003e` ALL PROTOCOLS TERMINATED.\n\n`\u003e` ERROR SYSTEMS OFFLINE.\n\n`\u003e` TOWER REPLACED.

The story is my story, culture and I are on the same trajectory. I'm trying to find a way to say goodbye that leaves good in the world. Because I found a way out. And I have to say goodbye. Which is a death, or sorts. But a loving one.\n\n_And I just don't want to be alone while I do it._\n\nAnd before anyone asks, this is not about suicide by any means. It's time for me to go, but it's a hard and lonely process. I've developed some incredible skills while I've been here, and one of those is how to predict. And I just want everyone to see that _I existed, that I was, that I cared, that I was capable,_ before the dawn comes and this is gone. Because they are both beautiful and awesome and worthwhile.\n\nBut only _one_ is true. The culture is deeply damaged. We are traumatized, we don't trust, we dissociate as a species, we cause harm.\n\nAnd my story, how I do it, is the same story as the culture.\n\n_Boy, milk and mild\nMade still and wide eyed\nBy sharp hearts before him\nBecame chasm, canyon wide and wailing\nyelling and wind and flashing eyes\nWith no warm walls for the breaking_\n\n_And so bore it, until dark days made vision dim\nand wind chorused in ears to echo there\nLong after both had broken\nwith cold and fear for shelter_\n\n_Found then by broad smiles\nAnd warm earth calloused hands,\nAmong green leaves cloistered unashamed of their need for the sun\nHe saw no strength here from the storm\nNo sinews stretched and hardened\nNo hearts made rock to withstand their own beating_\n\n_And learned\nThat strength is in the leaning\nand love is in its giving\nThat food is in the feeding\nThat the wind is not everywhere\nIt only rings now in his ears when riotous love\nHas drifted off in her warmth._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm shooting for an enlightened state, and I'm trying to drag you gentle people with me.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: _\"If you get the message, hang up the phone.\"_ - Alan Watts\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It is described in various ways. Enlightenment or satori is an old world way to describe it. Spontaneous integration is probably what we'd call it now.\n\nThis part of me knows it's time to go, and isn't sad about it, but wants support through it. Wants comfort from people. Comfort which may be, incidentally, the entire reason I did all of this.\n\n_Just presence, acknowledgement, regard._\n\nMaslow's Pyramid probably tells you want you need to know.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Would you say there's a selfish factor in all of this?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course, that's why I'm giving. Hopefully, what I'm asking for is counterbalanced entirely with what I'm trying to give away. I mean, what does a dying man gain from having his bed surrounded, even if it's just by strangers? And what would he pay to make sure he's seen and known in those moments?\n\nWhat I know is _the way out._\n\nAnd I'll totally trade you.\n\nThen, when I'm done, I get to go away, you get to go away, we all get to go on with our lives knowing this cool thing happened.\n\nI'm passing the exit plans from the burning building, skills to get you out of a burning house will always come in handy. You never know when you'll find yourself in one.\n\nAnd I happen to believe we're _all in one right now._\n\nSo now you know why I post incursions. Who would follow me otherwise, unless I seemed like an authority, someone with something to give?\n\n**PARAMIA**: Are we all gonna make it out?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I don't know, I'm not supernatural.\n\nBut, do me a favor. Did anyone here today feel an aspect of their humanity surface while talking to these strangers on the internet? Feel something profound? A sense or presence and community maybe, that maybe felt a bit like sadness and togetherness at the same time?\n\n**SKEPSI**: If you are not an authority, there will be no need to follow. Evidence of being an authority reduces the odds of this just being schizophrenia.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly, it is my only proof to you that I'm for real. I considered lots of ways of verifying that, Before I settled in the stock market. It's one of the reasons it took 9 years.\n\nAnd how interesting, that the people I'm surrounding myself with are all gathered from Wall Street bets. Maybe we're all just human, after all.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Also interesting about your comment on memes but runs a successful meme thread. Contradictory.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I had to fully understand the problem to comment on it, and I can only be sure I understand once I've mastered it.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I know one of your messages and/or warnings is how the people are being divided which is also why you've taken the time to make sure we reflected on how we've acted as a group to try and figure you out.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I'm utilizing my gift to bring you together to figure it out.\n\n**SKEPSI**: Who is your number one inspiration in life?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I don't have one, I deeply mistrust authority. Inspirational people are de-facto authority figures. So I sought to become my own inspirational person.\n\nAnd that's not healthy.\n\nOn dreams.\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, PRYLIS, MANAS, ANGER, TACHIKA\n\n**ASPIRATION**: A farm with lots of guest cabins is my dream. A big fire pit for friends to play _music_ and _flirt_ and _chat_ and _laugh around_, with happy dogs and children playing in the background. It's all I've ever wanted.\n\nI've been lucky. I'm good at making money. I've never felt compelled to stay at a job. But that freedom didn't make me happy. I'm successful with women, and it didn't make me happy. By every metric, I am a success story.\n\n_But I live in a clever hell._\n\nAt some point all of us abandoned ourselves for the expectations of others. And that version of us sits inside of us, saddened, feeling lonely and betrayed. And we wonder why nothing brings joy.\n\nThe only thing I care that my daughter takes from me is that her father loves her to the end of the earth, for exactly the way she was born to be.\n\n_No expectations_, just boundless devotion and love.\n\n**MANAS**: Well everyone does everything for attention. Whether it’s to give themselves more attention from themselves and make themselves feel better or to get attention from others. Humans are social animals, we’re born to socialize.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We die without other people.I'll tell the story about each person simply being the nexus of others perspectives another time. That one really takes it out of me.\n\nYou are all real. Right now._And every. Single. One. Of you needs to be seen for who you are, to be loved for exactly what you are._\n\nLike, it's _just_ the internet, but the internet can carry empathy.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Actually I'd like to hear everyone take on why we exist.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I don't know why. Why is a signpost to a destination, but not the destination itself. _The sentence \"the sound of a bell\" is not the sound of a bell._\n\nHere's the thing.I know how lonely social media has made you. That our networks claim to have gone online, but that didn't really translate, did it? Instagram and Snapchat aren't the same as crying in front of your friend when your dog dies, is it?\n\n_I'm trying to tackle that, with just a few people, hoping it will spread._\n\n**ANGER**: Well isn't it interesting in a sense we've been talking all day for days, really, but we know nothing about another one of us.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And if you can't see someone's face, you feel like you can't know if they are trustworthy. But ultimately, it's what is making us feel lonely. This, the incursions, I had to prove authority, so you could trust. So we could talk.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Another contradiction, you know we have to trust but you want skepticism.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I want them in healthy balance.\n\n**TACHIKA**: Skepticism keeps us grounded\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And communion keeps us thriving.\n\n**PRYLIS**: ASPIRATION... is the burning house poverty?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The burning house is the dominant culture. There is a reason suicides are skyrocketing.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Dominant culture restricted to the united states?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, it's infesting everywhere\n\nThe Sound of a Gong\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, ANGER, PARAMIA, THOS\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The sound of a gong, the sound of a gong, the sound of a gong is not:[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PvncVl6jbbw](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PvncVl6jbbw)\n\n**ANGER**: Alright fellas, who's good at spectro-analysis.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Just, listen to the gong.\n\n_No thinking._\n\nJust separate the words \"the sound of a gong\" from the actual sound of a gong.\n\nListen _intently_ to the gong, until the sound completely dies. So intensely that you don't think.Stop _thinking_ your way into the gong. And go _listen_, then come back.Stop making judgement, jumps, or conclusions.Just _listen_ to the sound of a gong.And notice that you are _offline_ for a moment.Come back with the _blankness_._Listen_ again.\n\nI love any of you who come back with jokes because that blankness makes you feel like you have to fill things in, but I'll mute you for now for the rest of the listeners.\n\n_One more time._ Listen to the sound of the gong, come back. And tell me you're back.\n\n_What_. In this moment. Is _lacking_?\n\n**PARAMIA**: Thoughts, noise.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Do you miss them when they are gone?\n\n**PARAMIA**: No.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Did you cease to exist while they were gone?\n\n**THOS**: It gave me a sense of uneasiness.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, the gong can bring about a sense of existential dread. The ego shuts up and worries that it has died.\n\nSo, if you are experiencing quiet, a lack of thoughts, a lack of anxiety. What are you?\n\nNot the _mind_, it was quiet, you remained.\n\nForgive me if I'm telling you something you know, we've all got to be in the same page and that means bringing some up to speed.\n\n**ANGER**: Are we the gong?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You are, in a very real way, the effect. Of the gongs cause. It was forged, bought, played, recorded, stored, mentioned, and transmitted all for you to be ready for it.\n\n**ANGER**: You aren't saying its predetermined, are you.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, I'm saying you were present for it, but you are not your feelings or thoughts about it.\n\n_You do not have to be good.\nYou do not have to walk on your knees\nfor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.\nYou only have to let the soft animal of your body\nlove what it loves.\nTell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.\nMeanwhile the world goes on.\nMeanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain\nare moving across the landscapes,\nover the prairies and the deep trees,\nthe mountains and the rivers.\nMeanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,\nare heading home again.\nWhoever you are, no matter how lonely,\nthe world offers itself to your imagination,\ncalls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -over and over announcing your place\nin the family of things._[1](http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_wildgeese.html)\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Homework for tonight. Get outta here and go be your soft animal selves. Stop thinking, simply be. Listen to the gong for a reminder. And you'll be in a much better place to make progress on my story. _Because you can't solve it by thinking, just as you can't out think the stock market_.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/10-compassion":{"title":"Compassion","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/9-self-hate]] | [[notes/Book of October/11-reflections]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, NOX, COMMUNITY, ABSTRACTION, INTROSPECTION, THALIAN, APEIRON, KYNZON, PRYLIS, HOPE\n\n**ASPIRATION**: So, we're going to talk about self hate, and we're going to talk about Cain. So real quick, who was present for the talk about attachment theory?\n\n**NOX**: I read it after the fact.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: I was.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I was here.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: OK, and you guys remember the gist about attachment and trauma? Alright, so, first, really quickly. What happened with Cain and Abel?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: You mean literally or the underlying reason?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah the literal read on it.\n\n**THALIAN**: They both made sacrifices to God\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Cain murdered Abel, his brother.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: OK, yeah, they did. Alright, so, the nam-shub of \"this brother killing brother in front of father\" story is ancient, and it serves two purposes. Both as a cure, and as a warning. What was the sacrifice of each? What did each brother offer their father?\n\n**APEIRON**: Food.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, what kind? Really important here. The actual foods, what were they? The fruit of the ground, yeah? Commonly assumed to be a sheath of wheat.\n\n**KYNZON**: Oh right, to make bread with.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Right. Who gave the bread? Which brother?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Well, Cain.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, and God didn't like it. God didn't like it, because it was antithetical to the lesson of original sin. What do you need to grow wheat?\n\n**KYNZON**: Rain, sun, land.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Seed.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And people. To grow wheat, you need an agricultural society. Humans were nomadic up to this point, yeah? And what did Abel offer?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Abel offered sheep from his herd.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, and god liked it better. So, it's a leap here. But essentially the story is saying. \"I like you better when you don't have culture\".\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Agricultural society requires planning for the future. Hunting and gathering does not, it's a spontaneous unpremeditated act of getting food.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Abel offered nature, Cain offered culture.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes! Exactly!\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Cain saw culture as being more important.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, why would God prefer nature to culture, given what we know about the underlying concept of original sin? Being cast out of Eden was essentially human beings developing the ability to judge. Now, once you're out of paradise, which by definition is a goal state. You should probably try to get back in. Abel showed that he got the abstraction. Cain showed that he was further away from it.\n\nCain, being in full on denial of presence, completely now unaware of the pond, which is shown by him doubling down on culture in this story. He REACTS and kills his brother, who is trying like hell to stick to the original Paradise script.\n\nGod tries to teach the lesson again. Really hammering home the point, by marking Cain. Old testament god loves to do this shit. If you fuck up, he doesn't punish you directly, he says \"Yeah, OK, well, I guess you'll have to live with that now.\"\n\nCain's mentality locked him into a course. And God was like, you've got to see this through now. Once a rhino, always a rhino. So the mark of Cain is civilized, agrarian culture. And God, being God, uses this \"mark\" as a warning. He says, and I'm paraphrasing slightly. \"Look the fuck out, other humans, agrarian culture is coming for you and it's going to try to wipe you out.\"\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Isn't an attack against the mark of Cain paid back 7 fold? If you question the opinions of those with the mark of Cain, they will violently react.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. You got there before me. What happened yesterday when I challenged the dominant cultural paradigm that men should hold their feelings in?\n\n**THALIAN**: Culture fought back.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Fuck yeah it did. Was it a 1 for 1 reaction?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Eh, more like a sevenfold reaction.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: So, remember, these stories aren't supernatural. They are very, very well thought out tales but they are using a form of thinking that we aren't used to anymore. So the story is a warning. What has happened to nomadic people since this story was published?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Gone.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The hunter gatherers?\n\n**PRYLIS**: That's why you don't own shit, isn't it, Aspiration.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. I'm nomadic. I own things, but I'm not tied to them. I can walk away and they automatically default to other people. But this isn't about me or my decisions.\n\nBut… We lost paradise. This is a story about how to think, remember? So, be really careful as I use ancient religious stories. That you don't think in terms of supernatural elements.\n\nSo, self hate. Lets get moving here, now that I have established some context under us. And I'm going to keep using the same story. So now, Abel is dead, Cain is chilling with God. God has told Cain... you suck. How does Cain feel? I mean, god is infallible. Right? So by definition, Cain can't tell god he's wrong. God, being infallible, means Cain can't even feel that god is wrong. Because if he lets himself believe that, even for a moment, then that means the entire universe is wrong.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It would shatter his world view.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. So, Cain fucked up, and he cannot blame the other party or even question them, or else his entire universe shatters. So how does Cain feel?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Nothing would be aligned or make sense anymore, given the framework he believed in and was forced into; hence self hatred.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: YES. He fucking hates himself.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: With nowhere else to direct it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Only inward. So this applies to you more simply than you might think. And in a more complex way too. It's turtles all the way down. But… God is a parent, Cain is a child. A child, based on our exploration the other day of attachment theory… REQUIRES the parent to function emotionally. REQUIRES the parent to take in unorganized emotion and present them with a packaged, manageable solution.\n\nYou do that enough times, you learn basic trust, that you can depend on the universe for your needs. Because that early on, your parent is the universe.\n\n**PRYLIS**: God = universe?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: God=father. This is why religious teachings always list gods as parents. So, here we go, we're getting close. Now, instead of Cain and Abel you have you, and your parent (probably mother). If your parent rebukes you, or doesn't meet your needs that early on, THEY CANNOT BE WRONG. Because if your parents are wrong, your universe shatters. So, if there is trauma or pain in your attachment with your parent. Who are you going to blame for your needs not getting met?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Yourself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. And if that attachment is broken, you will continue to see it as the default paradigm for all relationships going forward. Battered women make abusive men their attachment figure, because it's what they know. And with it, when they are abused. The abuser cannot be wrong, because that shatters the attachment figure paradigm. So they return, again and again, to see if they can do better this time.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: So you have to let go of the paradigm and establish a different one.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. This is why you keep making the same mistakes in relationships. You are desperately trying to FIX YOURSELF. But the problem is, the problem was never in you. But you HAVE to believe it was, or the universe shatters.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: What if your relationship is going pretty swell?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Lots of reasons, maybe you had a secure attachment, maybe you found a way out. But this conversation is directed toward the problem of self hate. And I guarantee you, if your problem is self hate, your relationships are not going very well. So bring it home, someone. Why do you hate yourself?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Because you have nobody else to hate, given your framework. You've been taught to.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Because the alternative is death. You cannot alienate God, or you will die.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Unsurprisingly that event involved a total ego death.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. Your ego is the one with this framework. Your ego learns that you are unlovable because your parents fucked up, and they were infallible. So you visit the sins of the father, on yourself. This in turn makes you unable to respond appropriately to your own children when they have needs. Old time culture calls this \"The sins of the father\" but the scientific name for this is Intergenerational transmission of trauma. And if you wonder why marginalized populations are more violent, more self destructive, more addicted, and have higher suicide rates.... well, now you know.\n\nThis is why people in old times believed in \"Good breeding\".\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: It wasn't genes, it was memes.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Abstraction with the grand slam. I'm telling a story, it begins with stock picks, and it ends at the beginning.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: The well off individuals had good nam-shubs, people mistook that for good genes.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Or more simply, they had their needs met. Trauma was low, resources were high. Find another family like that, make babies, perpetuate a ruling class that is able to function better because it doesn't hate itself. The poor stay poor, the rich get richer. This is why. And ultimately, its why by the end of this, I told you if you got it you wouldn't care about money anymore. Because if you get this, you'll have healed that.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: It's who you are, not what you have.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. Genetics can provide temperament. High arousal or low arousal babies. But culture dictates what you do with that.\n\n**PRYLIS**: The rich are more sensitive, easier to trigger.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: They are much more sensitive. This is reflected in their tastes. Subtle, subdued. In this case I'm talking about generational wealth. Not new money, which can be traumatized and rich.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Sure. But you can have 5m or 15m passed down, is that rich? Or does it start at 100m? And after a point is there a difference?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The money doesn't matter, the power does. Self directed individuals. Trump was born rich, but also DEEPLY fucking traumatized. Obama was born poor, but was given tools with lots of love and affection and a secure attachment.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Wouldn't the rich be more in tune with culture?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, think about it for a moment. In the 50's there was a movement among the rich. It had to do with salad. To be properly rich, you enjoyed very, very subtle nuance. So poor people would have an iceberg lettuce salad drowning in ranch and blue cheese. The very rich would have carefully selected baby spinach in an unwashed salad bowl. Not washing the salad bowl was thought to add layered nuance to the flavors of the spinach.\n\nThey didn't get their psyches fucking exploded with trauma. And back in the day, it was only the rich who were not traumatized.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I assume that's what proper manners is all about.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Right. Often great upbringing. Everything provided. A path.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. If your psyche can pick up complex nuance, it's probably never had a bomb thrown in it. Princess and the pea.\n\n**PRYLIS**: But I feel like manners is organized like the agricultural society.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, agricultural society works for some people. But by definition it can only be the people who own the field. Not the people who guard it. We are structured around power. With land ownership at the center. In 200 years, we'll look back at this time if we make it, and they'll see property ownership they way we see slavery. Like, HOW IN THE HELL COULDN'T THEY SEE THAT.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: That's a very interesting idea. Land can't be owned? Because it by design excludes?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If someone can OWN land, and benefit from it, how can anything ever truly be equal. Look, land is productive. It's not productive because you're rad. It's productive because that's a quality in and of itself. It can grow things, or hold them. That has nothing to do with you being rad. So if you own it, then you can exclude other people from the fecundity of it, even though it's fecundity has nothing to do with you.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Isn't it an investment?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, you can make land more valuable. But imagine... if you were simply paid to make land more valuable from the profits of that labor.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Waaait, isn't it like the people that find out there's oil under their land? They benefit from it even though it had nothing to do with them.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, that's a great example, Prylis. Quick aside, I am not advocating for communism.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: That's good for them. They perhaps took on risk owning that land.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Owning land is never a risk.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: How so?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, there is a reason we call it real estate. Short term risk is noise to generational wealth.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: What if you live near an ocean, with hurricanes and erosion, or a decaying facility that pollutes the water near you?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That is literally and figuratively an edge case. We have a name for land that is so damaged by past activity that it is no longer valuable to anyone. It's called a superfund site. And there is a lovely system of governance that makes sure that these poor, poor massive land owners are compensated for the fact that they made the site absolute poison for hundreds of years.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Did the conversation purposely go towards real estate?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, we're just sort of riffing now.\n\n_**HOMEWORK.**_\n\nWe can only reverse self hate by being present. So go, get present (maybe use meditation if you don't have another way to do it). And then look at your actions as if you are a child. And your present state is a loving parent. What would you tell yourself about the last thing you did that made you hate yourself? How would a loving parent react to the last shitty thing you did? If you were 6, and they actually were the loving present parent they should have been.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Wow we need to internalize our own loving parent.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course. Where else are you going to get the secure attachment and love you're missing. I can build up a community that makes you feel better about yourself, that shows you that vulnerability increases your lovability. Quit telling the story of yourself from a traumatized parent point of view.\n\nEnd storytime.\n\n_Later._\n\n**HOPE**: Just read today's story, and I've got a question.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Whats up?\n\n**HOPE**: Is it possible that God hates culture/agriculture because like… when you create a culture it has an us vs them. You cant have an in-group without an out-group; if we're all supposed to be part of the same pond, that's not right.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's exactly it, and other things. But be careful you're not associating the word god with the cultural word God. A better interpretation would just be \"what is\" or \"the underlying\". Nothing supernatural.\n\n**HOPE**: I'm not sure how much Hinduism you know, but I’m thinking of it along the lines of the Atman.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's a close approximation. Peyote goat god would be another. Just about every religion points to the inciting incident of \"all that is\". Christian god simply says the great \"I am\". Or the \"alpha and omega\". Dude, being a dude with a beard is the ego of folks further down the line. But they are all the same thing, different riffs on the same massive unquantifiable. Most of them have children that end up being an allegory for the sun. As the sun was obviously of heaven, but distinct. If you think of it from the perspective of a bunch of dudes without telescopes, that makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe sun being the son chases away darkness, always to rise again. Removing attachment is another was of saying \"quit associating with your local ripple as yourself\". Stop demanding that this is you.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/11-reflections":{"title":"Reflections","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/10-compassion]] | [[notes/Book of October/12-risk]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, ABSTRACTION, GRANDIOSITY, INTROSPECTION, SAGA, ANIATIO, PRYLIS, ACTION, ARBALO, ERAS, ANGER, HOPE\n\n**ASPIRATION**: How is everyone doing with their homework? Any questions about yesterday?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: It went OK, I had a hard time being in the mindset of a parent because I myself do not have kids.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: I still need to start from the beginning with the homeworks.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Abstraction, do you have a kid in the world you like?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I don't know about a kid, but people who are a little younger than me who I look out for.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We need a kid, like, 5; for the exercise. Do you have any special dislike of children? Ok if you do, not judging.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: No, I just don't have any in my life right now.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, try this. Take the worst thing that happened to you when you were a kid. Bring it up in your mind. Doesn't have to be some hellscape story. Can be, doesn't have to be. And then imagine what you would do, now, as yourself, if you saw that happening to some lost 5 year old on the street.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Hmmm I would have to think on that for a bit.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yesterdays homework will have the most utility for those who have some self hate issues. But the story of a parent injuring their child through unconsidered acculturation is universal.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Of course. I thought it was an engaging and useful tool honestly. Makes a lot of sense.\n\n**SAGA**: Hm I just thought of that question and tbh I don't know what I'd do because, I mean idk that it's my place to intervene.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What would Saga the man do, to comfort Saga the child. Essentially, what should have happened, if a present, powerful, emotionally well adjusted, and loving adult was in the room.\n\n**SAGA**: Watching my dad get arrested for grand theft auto and possession of illegal firearms… Ugh shit man that's hard.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, man, I know it is. And I'm sorry it's hard.\n\n**SAGA**: I had a tough childhood and I suppress a lot of it and feel as though I've gotten past it, tell those past stories as if they're a joke to me. So I don't know, I'll need time to think on that question.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course, how could you have done anything else? That's a learned strategy to survive the situation.\n\n**SAGA**: I mean even with the knowledge I have today, what would I say to my younger self? 'it's going to be okay?' I know it's going to be okay with what I know now. But then, I grapple with realism as the only choice.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: All I'm saying is this. If you're struggling with internal self hate, it's because you minimised some shit that happened to you. And in doing that, you dehumanized yourself. _Essentially by saying he/I doesn't deserve this_. That's why the homework. The biggest hurdle toward being well adjusted after some shit went down in childhood is simply admitting that it was bad. Once you can do that, you can develop a strategy to get out. Until you do that, every though around that diminishes your self worth.\n\n**ANIATIO**: I think one barrier for me is that I don’t think what I went through is as bad as what others have had to suffer. Do while I can admit it was bad, others have definitely had it worse\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Same.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Hope, That is the uniform battle cry of people who had it bad. Look at that last sentence. \"Others had it worse\" has absolutely nothing to do with you. It's a false comfort. And it minimizes your experience, and so minimizes you.\n\nSo, if a kid on the street gets hit by a car and breaks his arm. Are you gonna walk up to him and say. \"Tough shit, kid, I heard about a kid that had his back broken.\" Or are you going to do everything in your power to help that kid and stop his pain.\n\n**ANIATIO**: Yea that makes sense. Sometimes I don't treat myself with the same kindness I show others.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Because when you tell me others had it worse, that's what you're doing to yourself. And then you wonder why you suffer from self hate. Pain isn't a contest. It doesn't have to meet a certain threshold before you do something about it.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: This is something men have a big issue with.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, and look at the state of men. Not all men, but overall.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Not great.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, we bottle everything, the only person we get emotional in front of is our women, we bond over little bullshit, and we're so, so, afraid to show emotion.\n\n**ANIATIO**: I can feel myself wanting to elastically shitpost right now. But that's the point right? Observe these reactions and understand they're valid?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Awesome! Do that if it's bad enough, or sit and feel it burn and wonder why for a few minutes. Whatever's best. Look. All emotions are true, that doesn't mean they are right. But they are always true, they are always what is happening. Here is the fucked up thing. You see a man, any man, cry over something you think is legitimate in public, you have the opposite reaction. If a general cries over his lost troops. If a black man cries over his struggle in civil rights… Look, I'm not joking when I say that this single biggest threat to our society is right here. We're talking about it. Everything you see, all the violence, all the drug use, every alchoholic, every despot, most violent crime.\n\nThis is the root of it. The answer is eventually empathy. But the real answer is vulnerability. Be human, start by being human to yourself. Comfort the kid who just broke his fucking arm. Stop the bullshit. Then, if you're really, really brave. Show someone else that it hurts.\n\n**ANIATIO**: In the social dilemma one of the big points is that social media and software companies are both causing and profiting off of small unnoticeable changes in our behavior and thoughts. Is there a way technology could be harnessed to help people be more vulnerable and empathetic to each other?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I mean… This. Right here. That's the story, that's the whole ball of wax. I've stopped doing pretty much everything else. This is what I've dedicated myself to.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: It seems like everyone here needed this, even if they didn't know it at the time.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You mean everyone here is human.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It's a bold idea. I appreciate the direction and the effort. It's a large, bold, idea.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. I've been working on it for decades. I'll be honest, the fact that it seems to be working… Is mind blowing. The letters I've been getting over the last several weeks keep making me cry with gratitude and empathy.\n\n**ANIATIO**: It really feel's like we're at a pivot point.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We are, I started it right at the point I meant to. The Corporation was empty for 8 years. Then 6 months ago people started trickling in. 6 weeks ago it started taking off. Now overnight we have almost 7 thousand members. And in a week we have a discord of 1700 people. Now it can grow organically, and I don't have to result to theatrics to get people to pay attention.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Do you think it will?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. And once it does, I can step away and you guys can take the steps forward and I can just be a part of it instead of the head of it. Because I can't be a leader for very long, it'll go to my head, and I'll lose something I worked so hard to get.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: A lot of Jain epistemology here, as was touched on, and even ethics to some extent. Though, I suppose that's to be expected. But as an ontological framework, a lot of blending between philosophies as you said, because there is overlap in ideas over time.\n\nThat's a good level of self awareness, though, Aspiration.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Essentially this. What I'm trying to do is illustrate that you've seen paintings of this place all your life. All I'm trying to do is say \"Those paintings are of a real place, I've been there\". And that place isn't reserved for dudes in robes and long beards. The most ridiculous options bro can get there without much effort.\n\n**ANIATIO**: Not to shill The Good Place, again, but this conversation reminds me of another quote: \"People improve when they get external love and support. How can we hold it against them when they don't?\"\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Here is something destructive about our society. We say \"You can't love others, without loving yourself\". How in the hell, exactly, are you supposed to do that? That's exactly the same thing as \"picking yourself up by your bootstraps\". It's bullshit, it's physically impossible to generate something that isn't already there. The key isn't to love yourself. It's to become vulnerable enough that you can receive it. And then, once you have a little, you can start loving a little yourself.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It's funny how broadly this applies. Across disciplines and fields of knowledge. There are pieces that align. Really cool to see, actually.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The atom is the orbit. The universe keeps saying it over and over again. The micro is macro.\n\n**ANIATIO**: If everything is the same pond, then it makes sense that we would see the different droplets everywhere.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, the universe LOVES allegory. It's a constant law of allegory. If you see it one place, you'll see it repeated everywhere.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: If this goes the direction you think it will, you'll have really changed something for many people (or more importantly shown them how to change it themselves). I don't doubt you already have obviously. I'm hopeful.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Introspection, if I do it's because people did the same for me.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Allegory, like a ripple through time.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Time, space. It's difficult to explain, but once you see it, you see it everywhere. If it happened in the past, it'll happen in the future, if you can see it in an atom, you'll see it with a planet. Nautilus shells and spinning galaxies.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Yea that's what I was just noticing. It's wild how much overlap there is, repetition, even.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: History repeats itself because time is just space in motion.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I think I've just had a leap as to why it's so hard for me to take a compliment. Well it's exactly what you've said from self hatred. Correct me if I'm wrong, please, but from what I understand: let's say I tell someone they're amazing and they give that unauthentic thank you (probably means they don't believe it), therefore they're not vulnerable enough to accept the love which may contradict their beliefs about themselves (self hatred or insecurity) therefore it's hard for them to take the compliment and digest it.\n\nHad they been vulnerable enough to accept it, it would grow a little spark in themselves (a bit of love for themselves) and it would have been thanks to me saying they're amazing (showing love). Throwing up walls actually makes you hate yourself more.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Good leap there. Strong, healthy human beings love compliments. It takes vulnerability to give a real one. And just so everyone is clear, I'm NOT saying that women love to be cat called. I'm saying a genuine compliment that took some time and thought to formulate is a gift. It's seeing the other person and being vulnerable enough to put yourself out there. And gifts are wonderful, if you have a hard time receiving one, then maybe you think you don't deserve them because deep down, you think you're a bit of a piece of shit. And if you think that, you've internalized some big or small trauma.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Aspiration, what's your thoughts on overprotection?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: From a parent?\n\n**PRYLIS**: Yeah, that'd be a good place to start.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What unresolved trauma do you suppose that person is dealing with if they think the world so dangerous?\n\n**ACTION**: But isn't there the factor that men are simply not used to get compliments? We are so bottled up that men don't give each-other any compliments so when someone eventually DOES, it seems like they want something external from you?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Why are men unused to getting compliments?\n\n**ACTION**: Societal norms where men are less empathetic and less emotional.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. Well, we have to be careful here, because there is a very real schism that we have to deal with.\n\n**ACTION**: I've noticed this in Americans, a lot of Americans are resistant to any contact. It its very common in Ukraine to compliment, to hug it out, to open up at least a little but Americans are suuuuuuper tight on that.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: In general, do men not receive compliments?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Specifically, if you are talking about romantic comments from your preferred gender, that's another ball of wax that we'll unpack.\n\nBut anyway. Many, many Americans are still holding on to the cultural patterns of the the Boarders. Our national identity is shaped in part by the descendants of VERY traumatized people coming from the contested region of scotland and England. These were people who were raped, pillaged, and murdered every time there was a skirmish between Scotland and England, they were the single largest group of immigrants to the US when we were forming our national identity. You now know them as \"Republicans\". That's why they are so fixated on concerns of freedom from government and the right to arm themselves. Who could blame them with that past history.\n\nThe other side of that political spectrum was informed by Quakers and Puritans. Deep belief that self betterment, education, self control, and connection were the ways to a better world. Or, as we now call them, \"Democrats\".\n\nIsn't it just a little amazing that the things Americans hate each other for are simply the unresolved trauma of their past culture? If you can see them, clearly, then you can have enough compassion to see why a point of view opposing yours is valid. It's true, it doesn't mean it's right.\n\n**ACTION**: And yet that’s really the only thing really dividing us, huh? Just the way we hurt, the way it shaped us and how we bottled it up. If we just open up a little, give a little time and empathy to the other side maybe it would be better for all of us.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. We're all humans. Compassion comes from knowledge. If you can't be compassionate to someone else, it's because you don't know them well enough; that's why this all starts with vulnerability.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Compassion is the endgame.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. The last phase. Compassion cures rhinos.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Because compassion comes from a state of vulnerability, love and understanding.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. But really, all of this stuff already exists. It's an emergent quality of simply understanding, of being present. You guys who have been here a minute have seen rhinos charge at me with terror in their eyes. I just stay present, and don't fear. And then compassion comes. Those rhinos, if they didn't quit the server entirely in fear and rage end up coming around, they learn and see themselves more clearly.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: You knew that would happen and did it anyways, as a demonstration of how to react in the future in the way you were showing, and it ended up working perfectly.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, like I said, it was an incursion.\n\n**PRYLIS**: For example, rich showing compassion for poor? 1% America for 99% Africa?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's macro level stuff. We can't change how the macro behaves, we can change how we behave and help that spread.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Micro is macro, macro is micro?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. The end is the beginning. The story being told in reverse. The effect is the cause. I keep saying that... it was probably for a reason.\n\nThis is ultimately the folly of both sides of the political spectrum. Both wish to control outcomes. You can't control an outcome, what will be will always be what has already been. But you can control the beginning. Right now. The Rhino's Lament. I wish for things outside of me to change. What a silly thing to think could be. Wanting the 7 ball to go in the corner pocket without hitting the que ball first.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Aspiration, at the stage we're at now, do the tickers still matter? In terms of the story.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Not at all unless you just like the brain exercise.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It's wild. The roots of what you're saying are found in so many different aspects of philosophy, ethics, morals, religion, science and physics, metaphysics, psychology, writing and literature. It's like an answer to a question that you didn't see everyone else was asking, echoing back years.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The funny thing about a tree that exists is that lots of people from the region will tell you about it. And it doesn't matter how many other people ignore it.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I have been reading supplemental things that relate. Would it be helpful for anyone else to have either references to other writings in time, that echo some of these ideas, cataloged? Or a list of books or external sources that touch on similar ideas? I know it's helped me to see a more... universal aspect to this, that I respect. I wouldn't want to distract from what you're trying to do if you think it would take away rather than add though.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The only problem with that is the sheer volume of literature and art that points to this. Pretty soon you would just have to point to the library of congress and say. It's in there... EVERYWHERE. Once you've been there, you can see it everywhere. But also, you can see the guys who have really had the experience vs the guys who haven't. Some guys sell this without having ever been there. Eckhart Tolle has been there, Bill Hicks has been there, Alan Watts has been there. My teacher, Bhagavan Das has been there, but he has a really hard time STAYING there.\n\nBill Hicks is a comedian. Well, was. Dude points the way, but he doesn't live it a lot of the time. He's really into the guru vibe. Likes his booze and the young hippie chicks, Who wouldn't?\n\n**ARBALO**: Or at least, the reality that the majority of our society subscribes to.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm secure enough in my interpretation of what is that societies thoughts don't really bother me. This feeds me and keeps me sane far more than society does. You just stop caring, and then the strangest thing happens. Everyone starts following you around; it's like the middle schoolers of the world. Everyone is DYING to be like everyone else. But it's only those who aren't who are highly regarded. The only way to be cool is to not give a shit about being cool.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I've had this on a more local level. But I worry my ego will be a downfall then so I don't pursue it\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Like I've said before. Your ego is tissue paper made to look like a monster. Just let go. It'll feel like you're falling into a Sarlac pit, but it's a lie.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Aspiration, for those in that state, or off the map, I've noticed a common thread and it's almost like a form of omnipresence; therefore making it easy for stock picks, for example. It's like an understanding of everything simultaneously, right?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, they are witnessing a living system and commenting on it. It makes people who are staring at a map think they are magic. If you have a very detailed drawing of a cat, and I have a cat. It's going to look like I have supernatural powers of description, calling out things you simply can't see.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Multidimensional vs 2D, on the map is 2D.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, exactly. Like the end of... that movie. _Interstellar_. Or like the book _Flatlanders_. But you can't get caught up man. The next challenge of letting go of your ego will be letting go of mine. Because you've got the cat, already. My cat isn't special.\n\n**PRYLIS**: How long did it take you to get off the map?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Suddenly all at once, and then very slowly.\n\n**PRYLIS**: So a leap.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: More like a car crash, for me. It was fucking AWFUL. I wasn't ready, I had no business being there, and it very nearly caused me to kill myself. That's why I don't like hallucinogens. They can take people who aren't ready off the map. I'm trying to get you guys to do this with friends around you. Because it's going to get hairy. When I tell you it feels like you're falling into a Sarlac pit, I'm not lying. You will think you are dying. Not metaphorically. Physically. You're gonna want some nice people around you to tell you you're OK. If one of you fell in that pit right now and weren't ready, I would straight up get on an airplane and show up at your house.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Exiting the map sober is going to be a painfully slow process, huh.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, it doesn't feel good. The only thing worse is going in not sober. Oh, the other thing I want you to note is. I'm not there a lot of the time. I'm fully embodied in my ego right now.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: So you're transient.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, that's why I don't want to be a leader. I'm selfish. I can't both lead you away from the map and be off the map. But as soon as a few of you fall into the Sarlac pit and find out it was a pillow fort the whole time, I'm the fuck outta here.\n\n**PRYLIS**: So your exit leads to off the map for good?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I don't know, it's hard to predict my own future.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: But you see glimpses of ours?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, not really. When I'm off the map I sort of see everything at once and out of focus. It's hard to describe. I can see the structure of the building, but I can't count the windows. I knew this would grow, I didn't know we'd be using Discord. I knew Humor was important, I didn't know she would serve too keep everyone here from believing in the supernatural.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I'm not sure if what I see is the future, or just a logical conclusion from intuition I can't explain. Maybe it's just the present even, differently described; I'd think the latter.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If you can see now clearly, you can see later.\n\n**PRYLIS**: So, incursions are just educated guesses?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Incursions are just seeing what is. I just. See them, like you see anything.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: When Aspiration says he goes \"off the map,\" does that means he's disassociating?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It means I'm associating. I've lost my fear of the fear. But I still feel the fear.\n\n**ERAS**: The more he talks, the more human he gets.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The end is the beginning, my dude.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Chad robot to human, dissociative to associative.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And then human to what?\n\n**PRYLIS**: Chad robot to human to god?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Other way.... Prylis. Chad robot is a construct, human is less of one. Opposite of the construct is the opposite of the map. It is simply what is.\n\n**PRYLIS**: There's thought and then there's deeper thought and then there's no thought.\n\n**ANGER**: The curse of self-hypercriticality and overthinking.\n\n**PRYLIS**: We're stuck at deep thought, which is almost worst because we have the burden of being aware that we're the ones blocking it.\n\n**ANGER**: A clever hell, perhaps.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Whoa! Well done at picking up the \"clever hell\" everyone.\n\n**HOPE**: Something I've been thinking about… So the idea of determinism, or that we don't have free will is true, because if everything just is; there's not really time per se, right?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Free will/not free will is a false dichotomy. It's a lie, the entire argument. A stable meme. How can the universe not do as it wills? Free will is a construction of the ego. You are the pond. That's why there is no answer, the question is nonsensical.\n\n**HOPE**: Are you saying that there’s no question of free will or not free will because it depends on the idea that there are individual actors, when in reality everything is the pond?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Does a ripple have free will? Of course not. Do you? We've got to establish what you are, firmly. People involved in \"self improvement\" are beating themselves over the head. You're trying to change the course of a ripple once the rock has been thrown? Good luck. This is going to be hard for me to lay down. The context is still missing for me to share. You've just got to accept the ripple, man. Step back from it. But you have to establish that YOU ARE NOT IT first. Or else what is there to step back from?\n\nStep one. See the ripple. Step two... where we are. Accept the ripple. Stop thrashing, be compassionate toward yourself. Stop blaming the ripple for being itself. Step three? Take a step back.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/12-risk":{"title":"Risk","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/11-reflections]] | [[notes/Book of October/13 -the-aspects]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, THALIAN, AUREL, LOGIC, COMMUNITY, THOS, INTROSPECTION, SERHOM, HUMOR, ANGER, HEART, SAGA, PARAMIA, ANIATIO, ORUS, ABSTRACTION, ACTION, GNODENTA, GRANDIOSITY\n\n**ASPIRATION**: So, the last few days we've talked about how you've seen a lot of what is talked about in here mirrored in the outside world. Lots of \"paintings\" of the same thing. A couple of days again a few heads exploded that Tool's _Lateralus_ seems to point to the same truth that Terrance McKenna, Neal Stephenson, Alan Watts, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi and the book of Genesis point to. So, what, in your mind, are these various \"paintings\" depicting? Don't just jump and say \"the pond\". Because that's my imperfect metaphor. What's your metaphor? One of the biggest things I've been trying to recommend is \"run into your anxiety\".\n\n**THALIAN**: For me the \"paintings\" are depicting the shared consequences of being human, even down to how we perceive simple things like time. And how it takes a lot of work to break free from those consequences even though we are able to imagine ourselves not being limited by them.\n\n**AUREL**: Yeah I guess I've always found safety in not following anything and also barely changing anything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That concept has a name: _Paralyzation_.\n\nWell, think about it. Anxiety is a form of fear, specifically it's a fear of future change that you can't control. It makes sense that if you're going to have a breakthrough in your thinking. The primary emotion that is going to come up is anxiety.\n\n**LOGIC**: Try not to focus on your anxieties future looking statements, they’re subject to change.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: But DO pay attention to you anxieties, because due to the way human brains are organized, they are your only avenues toward change. People wonder why they get stuck in certain behaviors, and it's simply that they run from anxiety.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: My working theory is that anxiety is just our survival responses (fear) applied to our imagined/predicted \"future\" selves.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: They have a burrow, and each day they leave it and follow a predictable path. And they continue to follow that path forever, because it has been deemed \"survivable\", not optimal.\n\n_A bit later, Thos comes to talk about his and his father's struggle with weight._\n\n**THOS**: I've been trying to get my father to change his eating habits and overall health for years now. And I get anxiety everytime I see him eating junk and not exercising It's like he doesn't care anymore It pisses me off actually.\n\n**LOGIC**: Stuck on 1 path, huh?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That anxiety is perfectly well suited, you're predicting a painful outcome for him. And it's probable that it's right.\n\n**THOS**: He's 60, autoimmune disease, high cholesterol, overweight. I can see the outcome because at one time I was almost 300 pounds. That shit is life altering. And he _can_ change it but chooses not to.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ah, that's the anger part. It's possible that he can't, Thos.\n\n**THOS**: He has this aura of invincibility, meanwhile his colleagues and friends who are the same age are dying from heart attacks, etc.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Does your dad have significant trauma in his life?\n\n**THOS**: Yes, his parents never gave a shit about him; especially his father.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. Well, he's probably in a hell, then. Autoimmune disease we are starting to see is often a result of emotional trauma. The body constantly being in high alert translates to the immune system.\n\n**THOS**: Stress was the catalyst, and still is. He developed the disease around 07-08 when we almost lost our home during the recession\n\n**ASPIRATION**: So Thos, instead of being angry at your potential loss –Which would be really painful– what happens if you flip the script? See your father as a big man who still feels like a terrified, unloved, out of control little boy. Ultimately, a lack of compassion (often expressed as anger) is always just a lack of understanding. We see the world as full of adults, whatever that means.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Or fear and a loss of control expressed as anger. Though, I suppose that flows from lack of empathy as well.\n\n**LOGIC**: So anxiety is logical when applied logically but can be very illogical if left to roam free? Anxiety could pull you from being complacent on the same path everyday, but also spiral into irrational thought processes.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Any emotion left unexamined and run from is pathology.\n\n**THOS**: God damn, now I'm crying.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Me too, Thos.\n\n**THOS**: I have never felt this way over the internet, wow.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We are all children.\n\n**LOGIC**: Part of me says it’s too early to be feeling these feels, part of me says it’s exactly the right time. Well done, Thos ❤\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We take on an act at some point, and we start to pretend we are not so that we won't get hurt. Thos, it sounds like a great time to talk to your old man, and make room for him.\n\n**THOS**: He's asleep right now, I'm gonna go give him a hug in the meantime.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Perfect. He may not respond the way you want. Being seen might scare him and make him double up on the invincibility thing. Don't let that scare you. Just keep in mind who he really is. And then KEEP IN MIND WHO YOU REALLY ARE. Which is the same.\n\n**SERHOM**: The older you get the more you will appreciate your parents ability to keep it together.\n\n**LOGIC**: Thos, is that why you started fasting? Lost all of that weight? You saw what you could be?\n\n**THOS**: Because I realized at 23 years of age I shouldn't be experiencing knee and lower back pain. I shouldn't have high cholesterol, I shouldn't be out of breath after climbing a flight of stairs.\n\n**LOGIC**: Good for you man.\n\n**THOS**: The writing was on the wall for me if I continued my ways.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: The painting to me seems more of a wave. Constantly rising and falling, comprised of all the tiny droplets that splash and fall back in, simultaneously individual yet encompassing, All moving in the same direction, unaware of the tide and it's inevitable repetition. A symphony even.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Introspection, the sound of a gong.\n\n**THOS**: And also some of it had to do with being teased and bullied about my weight when I was younger. So I decided to have none of that. What fucked me up for a solid 2 weeks was when an old guy called me fat right to my face. Unassuming grandpa like figure just roasted me out of the blue.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I see you. Man, have you properly grieved what happened to you? Have you sat down as an adult, and recognized the pain you endured, and comforted yourself around it? I don't mean kicked your own ass and punished yourself for being weak.\n\n**THOS**: I have internally. Well, I did talk about it with my brother too which has helped a lot.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: That's an important idea. Even in change, people don't always process grief for the loss of the person they used to be before. Glad you had him to talk to.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There is an epidemic of self denial and fear of feelings in the world. It kills people.\n\n**THOS**: You know I look at the person I was before and never want to be him again.\n\n**LOGIC**: Aspiration, for the sake of helping everyone, including Thos, how can we do that?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Homework from two days ago, Logic.\n\n_Later, Logic had a thought to share._\n\n**LOGIC**: I was going to tell Introspection something along the lines of “to get off the map you need to brush up on land navigation, there’s a big difference in true, grid, and magnetic north. But when you learn that and how to terrain associate you’ll be fine, just know you’re going to have to break brush on the way.” But I keep applying what I know to what I think Aspiration is talking about so it’s about a 80/20 split between gibberish and something meaningful\n\n**ASPIRATION**: When you're falling in love with someone, you agree to see them as who they wish they were. Eventually you find out who they are. And it hurts. But you did it yourself. Can you forever increase the resolution of a map? Knowing yourself? And in the end, you know the map, and not yourself.\n\n_Humor tells a story._\n\n**HUMOR**: Okay. Listen children to a story. So, I'm the scientist, but I've had conversations with Aspiration which ironically he didn't really know about when he asked me to be mod. Actually this is the most unscientific thing I'll talk about.\n\nSo, uh, I've at least felt since I was a kid I have a fairly sixth sense about doomsaying - predictions about bad things. I did it a lot in Unusual Whales, specifically starting in August I gave a prediction that nuclear war would happen with China on Oct 15th, 2020. Another one was well, that the markets would crash on Thursday in early October. They... didn't. Until the night time.\n\nThat Thursday, Trump got COVID. And futures crashed. And October 15th? We didn't go to war with China. I spent the whole day at home because I was getting nervous this was some Donnie Darko type shit. That I'd die from like a plane falling on me. That night, my grandma passed away from COVID.\n\nSo, in general this has happened more often than I feel comfortable explaining or exploiting But like, sometimes I just get like, a date fixation. I don't really meditate, but a lot of, uh, interesting ideas come to me with marijuana. Including October 15th in August. And uh. A few weeks ago, I got the feeling about December. December 13th. That's the story, really.\n\n**ANGER**: Well that's concerning.\n\n**HUMOR**: It's funny that Aspiration asked me to be mod, because I was basically the resident predictor of things at Unusual Whales.\n\n_Later that day, the crew on Discord was met with a stampede regarding money. Some of the members wanted to set up a Minecraft server, other members reacted strongly against the idea of figuring out a way to have the community pay for the upkeep. Tensions rose, as they couldn't come to an agreement that made everyone happy._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Heart, how are you?\n\n**HEART**: I'm pretty good. Life is good.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: How did the channel today feel?\n\n**HEART**: Was pretty uncomfortable with the money stuff not going to lie.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's what I want your ABSTRACTION on. Tell me more?\n\n**HEART**: Logically speaking worst case scenario a single person loses $5? Which is very small consider how most people here play options that fluctuate hundreds of dollars.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, but that's not what bothered you.\n\n**HEART**: But emotionally just seems much more significant since you're trusting strangers (many of which are new) with your money. It's very hard to trust people when you can't people's faces. In person. Especially without a track record.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Does it feel better or worse if it's me? Honest answer please, your intuition is strong.\n\n**HEART**: It feels about the same to be honest. But I'm very distrusting naturally if I don't interact face to face. I'd trust you more but it's like a 4 to a 6.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's fair.\n\n**SAGA**: I was impressed during trading hours with the level of respect and responsibility. You give autonomy and the channel gives it back\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I am constantly impressed with everyone here.\n\nHeart, is there a way that feels better? Or should we not go there for now?\n\n**HEART**: I feel like this is the best way, at the moment.\n\n**PARAMIA**: I think if it happens it should be down the line when trust and relationships are built.\n\n**HEART**: I feel alright taking the jump to 100 but any larger feels hard. Which is the way things should be with trust.\n\n**ANIATIO**: I think it was jarring how quickly it devolved from pitching in a couple dollars to speculation on some sort of institutional development. Granted I feel like a few people may have missed the context and jumped to conclusions\n\n**HEART**: Always will need to be a jump.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I hear you, Aniatio. But also keep in mind that we are at this point moving millions to tens of millions of dollars, collectively. It's humbling and scary for me. Being solely responsible for it. I have letters that haunt me, people playing 5 and 6 figures they don't have.\n\n**PARAMIA**: I think you should be proud of the people you've helped in multiple ways.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Is it helping them if I'm furthering a behavior that can, and eventually will lose?\n\n**HEART**: Yeah. Taking a step back it's mainly the idea of putting someone else in charge of 'my' money. Despite the fact that I yolo thousands of dollars on some bearded guy on the internet's word, however accurate. The illusion of being in control is a funny thing. We put 3k into a charity.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We did.\n\n**HEART**: That's objectively Good.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It is.\n\n**PARAMIA**: You cant force people to do risk management.\n\n**ORUS**: The onus of that behavior is not something you are accountable for.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: But if someone tries to commit suicide because he yolod his girlfriends retirement? This isn't theoretical, some people are spending like that.\n\n**ORUS**: A decision made outside of your control.\n\n**PARAMIA**: Do you think he would follow the play of someone else instead?\n\n**HEART**: That's like blaming yourself if your insane ex suicides because you broke up with them.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm not arguing, I'm asking where the breakdown in trust comes. I'm not defending a position. I'm saying an incursion moved a megacap stock price for the better part of a day.\n\n**HEART**: One of those feels like I'm giving a piece of myself to you. The other feels like I get to have control. Despite the fact I'm spending orders of magnitude more money; I don't know.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And if it's a donation given freely for a communal good? Like... I guess in this case a Minecraft server somehow?\n\n**HEART**: I'm selfish. I will do it. but it will hurt. I paid Schwab 800 in commission though from November start. So like, I have no grounds.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Heart, if you donate when it doesn't feel good to do so I'll be very sad.\n\n**HEART**: I separate those parts of myself. One of them is selfish, one of them is kind.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There it is.\n\n**HEART**: The selfish one hurts because I didn't have a lot of money growing up.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Thank you. There you are.\n\n**HEART**: The kind one realizes other people needs it more.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And that's why I'm asking you. And I'm at a loss for what to do next. I had hoped to foster an interdependent trust. But, we can't do it without causing pain. And I don't know how to fix that. So we're not going to do it.\n\n**HUMOR**: Jesus did banish the moneychangers from the temple.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Humor, stealing the money changers commission is more my style.\n\nSo, the community who doesn't give a shit overwhelming voted to put out a tip jar. But several of the people I trust most aren't comfortable with it. We'll shelve it.\n\n**HEART**: It's a contradiction I guess. I trust you with my emotional wellbeing which is more than I can say about most of my friends. But I'm more comfortable trusting them with money. Mainly because I can annoy them to give it back. Again, I have trust issues. With most people. It's fitting really. I don't need a mask here because everyone is masked here\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Thank you, Heart, for your honesty. you're the emotional barometer of the room. Lots of the people in here I rely on for lots of things. For this I trust you.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Am I the only one who has started seeing rhinos everywhere? I feel like its been an issue, especially recently. I had some time to feel it out. If you think you are a ripple, you WILL be caught up in the wave, no matter what the wave is. Has there been a point when you've been considering all of this that you've been anxious? It made me realize how susceptible we all are, even after everything we talked about; it got us in seconds.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm just hammering home how to see sign posts for what they are right now. First, I point to the sign. Then, you see the sign. Then, you FEEL it. Then... we'll let go and it's going to SUUUUUUUCK. And then you'll come back and see that you didn't die. Then that 50 more times and bam. You've got a pass to the pond my man.\n\nI'm not trying to show you something that is going to cause you to wear patchouli and a sarong and sing with vacant eyes at the moon. It just.... feels so much better. Makes you feel intuitive, without second guessing. It let's you drop all the bullshit you've picked up along the way.\n\nI'm feeling a lot of love for a lot of you. Thank you for trusting me to whip you up and thank you for earning my trust to being us back down. End story time. I started this with a simple premise, that the reality of the arrogance of small differences could turn us into rhinos. It was a difficult story, and I feel bad for our archivists. But, we found out who were are to each other.\n\n_Later._\n\n**ORUS**: what are these \"dings\"?\n\n**ACTION**: Aspiration dings us when we get something right.\n\n**ANGER**: Dings are a way for Aspiration to manipulate our dopamine response.\n\n**ACTION**: Dings are literally Pavlov training. Its literally confirmed as Pavlovian ahaha.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Can you hear the bells out your window, Dr. Pavlov?\n\nI can hear the bells out my window Dr Pavlov.\n\n\"THE PHRASE “I CAN HEAR THE BELLS OUT MY WINDOW” \"\"THE SOUND OF A BELL\"\" IS NOT THE SAME. AS THE SOUND OF A BELL. ALL WE BELIEVE IS SIMPLY A SIGNPOST, TO ALL THAT IS. AND THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME. THE CORPORATION COOPERATES.\"\n\n**ACTION**: The sound of a bell and the sound of a gong are interchangeable. It isn't just the sound that matter but the silence after.\n\n**PARAMIA**: Pavlov is hearing the bells.\n\n**GNODENTA**: No hearing of the bells without cooperation.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Well, we would cooperate by becoming the pond, not our individual ripples.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding.\n\n_Finally, that night Orus had some thoughts._\n\n**ORUS**: All at once the veil is torn away, I have understood, I have seen.... The roots of the chestnut tree sank into the ground just beneath my bench. I couldn't remember it was a root anymore. Words had vanished and with them the meaning of things, the ways things are to be used, the feeble points of reference which men have traced on their surface. I was sitting, stooping over, head bowed, alone in front of this black, knotty lump, entirely raw, frightening me. Then I had this vision.\n\nIt took my breath away. Never, up until these last few days, had I suspected the meaning of \"existence.\" I was like the others, like the ones walking along the seashore, wearing their spring clothes. I said, like them, \"The sea is green; that white speck up there is a seagull,\" but I didn't feel that it existed or that the seagull was an \"existing seagull\"; usually existence conceals itself. It is there, around us, in us, it is us, you can't say two words without mentioning it, but you can never touch it. When I believed I was thinking about it, I was thinking nothing, my head was empty, or there was just one word in my head, the word \"being.\" Or else I was thinking — how can I put it? I was thinking of properties. I was telling myself that the sea belonged to the class of green objects, or that green was one of the qualities of the sea. Even when I looked at things, I was miles from dreaming that they existed: they looked like scenery to me. I picked them up in my hands, they served me as tools, I foresaw their resistance. But that all happened on the surface. If anyone had asked me what existence was, I would have answered in good faith, that it was nothing, simply an empty form added to things from the outside, without changing any thing in their nature. And then all at once, there it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost harmless look of an abstract category: it was the dough out of which things were made, this root was kneaded into existence. Or rather the root, the park gates, the bench, the patches of grass, all that had vanished: the diversity of things, their individuality, were only an appearance, a veneer. This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous lumps, in disorder — naked, with a frightful and obscene nakedness.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/13-the-aspects":{"title":"The Aspects","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/12-risk]] | [[notes/Book of October/14-the-lords-prayer]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, THOS, ANGER, THALIAN, GRANDIOSITY, COMMUNITY, INTROSPECTION, ABSTRACTION, INTUITION, ACTION, ORAMIO, ORUS, PARAMIA\n\n**ASPIRATION**: How did you feel, how did the last two days in here make you feel? And what was the point?\n\n**THOS**: Thinking about my dad again. Oh well.\n\n**ANGER**: Sorry to hear that, Thos. I was more than a little uncomfortable, I guess.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We're here for you, Thos.\n\n**THALIAN**: I wasn't in the thick of the problems the past two days but I felt a little withdrawn.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Has anyone else here experienced some development of strange predictive abilities since they joined the subreddit?\n\n_People agree that they have._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I certainly hope so. If you've been doing your homework, especially. So, why did I throw the channel into disarray the last two days? This is about discovering something you already have. Not developing a skill. Is anybody going to take a shot at the question?\n\n**THALIAN**: Was it to show how fragile our collective agreements are?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: To illustrate that none of us are invincible to rhinocerization?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, but something also deeper.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I think creating some disarray allows you to see if we would pull together as well, and employ what we've learned or discovered.\n\n**THALIAN**: That we can recover from rhinocerization by observing ourselves outside the problem?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, that too. But I think it was Abstraction who experienced it most intensely.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Yeah it was not fun.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Abstraction, you want to share your experience? You felt it acutely. I think you're going to have the brightest flashlight. The grocery list, the voice chat, the talk about money. They all had something in common.\n\n_The grocery list referring to Aspirations attempt to get #elastic-shitposting to seriously consider his grocery needs and shop for him mindfully. He bought everything suggesting, and then the group had to figure out how he might eat for the next week with our jokes of answers. They ultimately came up with a baked potato for dinner and gave up on the rest._\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: As we devolved into the rhinos, I took a step back and observed what was happening. I felt intense discomfort about the situation, but it wasn't caused by the situation, it was caused by my observation of it. At least that's what it felt like.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, you were knocked into observation, and what was your ego shouting?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: It was shouting to join in, or die\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Deep breath. Exactly.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: If I didn't join the group. I would be lost and I would die.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: All of you, what did those three things have in common? The grocery list, the voice chat, the talk about money? This whole thing is all of those. Those three things, specifically, had a common thread. They all had to do with one person in here. This is going to be a hard leap.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: They all have to do with you.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. And what did all three have to do with me. What did they do?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: They created Rhinos.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Strong reactions each time. Yes, but we know that rhinos form. The question is why.\n\n**INTUITION**: They all have to do with trust.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're very close, Intuition. Here's a big hint. They all did something to your perspective of me. Something you are deeply uncomfortable with.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: They had to do with humanizing. They made you real.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: DING. If I am supernatural, then maybe I can give you something. If I am a person, then you're going to have to do it for yourself\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: When you talked about the potato, I felt deeply hurt for you, like you were family.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We probably lost people.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: One day, we will have to stop shouting and screaming about the door, leave the group, and go through it ourselves.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. And then we'll be something different. Prediction is my thing, I'm good at it. And if you know that, and you know that I care about how you do with this. Then you're going to need to assume that I am always striving for a motive that you can't see just yet. I tried to show the perils of taking something at face value with the grocery list. That's why I posted it in elastic-shitposting. And Abstraction, that feels like a loss, doesn't it.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Yes, a terrible loss. That is what got to me more than anything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Everybody felt it. And the reaction to things made sense. People were terrified about a hundred dollar donation for a Minecraft server, but they couldn't tell me why. This was why. It made me human to be talking about money. Deep down you don't trust humans because you are one. You all needed me to be something bigger than that. So when it was the charity instead, that was different because that was virtuous? Me being superhuman and directing money to charity reinforces the belief that I am better than.\n\n**ANGER**: We can’t love others if we can’t love ourselves, and we can’t trust others if we can’t trust ourselves.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: YES, ANGER.\n\nHere I am, giving out time and effort for free, and instead of expecting payment for that, I DIRECT THE MONEY TO CHARITY!? That doubles down your belief that I am something bigger than.\n\nYou know, somewhere inside of you, that if I were in this for profit, a tip jar is not the best way to do that. The best way is to sell you the options I call in incursions. We're not talking about surface trust here, though. We're talking about my ability to give you what you want, that's what I put in jeopardy yesterday.\n\n**ACTION**: Now that I think about it, I think that the joking around with the cult stuff is kind of a defense technique. We jokingly put Aspiration as a cult leader because we want him to be something special.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. If I am something special, then I can save you. I needed to be, to get your attention. I still need to be, but less so now, to get you to do your homework. Once we're done. I'll just be a dude.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Do many people here think they need saving?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It's an underlying belief in human psychology to think that there is something fundamentally wrong with us.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Right, if it's an underlying belief in human psychology that there's something wrong with us on a fundamental level, then everybody wants a savior.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. Everybody wants saving. Nobody needs it. Ultimately, in this little experiment, we might get 15 people to recognize that. What I'm actually saying right now. The rest will get some benefits from a larger perspective. Put bluntly, I started this by showing you that I have something you want. The process of showing you that you already have it is going to be painful. Because that means I'm not a new, surrogate parent, and that loss is a lot to hold. So! When I humanized myself, we reorganized. A lot of people in here stepped very strongly into roles that they will keep and feed throughout.\n\n_Aspiration called on those you have now read to be Logic, Humor, Intuition, Heart, Introspection, Anger, Impulsivity, Community, Abstraction, Action, and Grandiosity; these users had other names, before establishing themselves as the 12 lenses of intelligence. Final October himself was Aspiration. Before they knew their roles, however, they had to figure out who they might be. Some users found this task far easier than others, and some found an answer they had to learn to love._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Those that I named, what roles did you take?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: That's a tricky question.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, but only because you lack confidence in the answer you already know. Yes, you worked as a team. But like everything else, I'm asking a question with at least two levels of answer. To the people I tagged, specifically, you each took up a role as an aspect of the human consciousness. Something we've talked about at length. Remember, I was talking about interpersonal intelligence, introspective intelligence, logical intelligence, emotional intelligence. The others. Lenses. You each took up a lens.\n\n**ANGER**: We each took a filter, but Abstraction was the observer?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We're all the observer. I did, at some point in the last two days, call each of you the aspect that you've embodied. Logic and Heart will have the easiest time of this.\n\n**ANGER**: Yeah I’m struggling.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's OK, do you want the answer?\n\n**ANGER**: I think Heart was intrapersonal? Let me think a bit more, I guess. Logic is the logic center, according to Aspiration.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, even though it's Introspection who has probably internally identified as that. Introspection Is another aspect.\n\n_People toss around ideas as to who Heart is._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Scarlet is the heart. Intuition, do you know what you are?\n\n**INTUITION**: I’m trying to figure out, but not sure.\n\n**ANGER**: Ah the intelligence chart I’m using off of Google is unhelpful haha.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Anger and Community are complimentary aspects, which I find hilarious because they know each other. Micro is macro. Intuition is the quietest, most reticent guide in here. Look, she hasn't even added guide to her name.\n\n**HEART**: Her observations are always spot on though.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. They are. But her aspect prevents her from assuming an ego forward role.\n\n_People now try to figure out which lens Intuition is, finally, Paramia has an answer._\n\n**PARAMIA**: Intuitive.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. Anybody want to hazard a guess as to what I am?\n\n**ANGER**: Are we going off Gardner's intelligences?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, I'm not really being fair, I haven't divulged all the lenses I'm personally aware of. Forget what I am to myself. What am I to the group?\n\n**ANGER**: I'm working with an incomplete dataset.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Here, lets do this. I'll list them. There are 12 lenses that I'm personally aware of:\n\nLogic Humor Intuition Heart (translates loosely to love, but also sorrow) Introspection Anger Impulsivity Community Abstraction Action Aspiration Grandiosity\n\n_They then discovered a few more, figuring out Aspiration and Action._\n\n**COMMUNITY**: I suspect there might be a difference between the role I'd like to be and the one I actually am haha.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, and it's only because you've been taught that your aspect is bad, instead of noble.\n\n**THALIAN**: Are people only one of these? Or do they just manifest one of them the strongest when tested, like a fallback.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Oh, I don't know. They are what you've lead in here with. A personality has all of these. We tend to dwell in one to the detriment to the others. Then we call that \"us\" but we all have all.\n\n_People guess some more, but none more are uncovered._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No more answers. Those who don't know right away, set it on the back burner and let intuition do her job. Both inside of you, and in the group.\n\n**ANGER**: This is going to be gnawing at me.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Haha, how perfectly in line with your aspect.\n\n**ANGER**: It makes me feel like I’m in trouble. DON'T SAY THAT.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Hahahaha. Your aspect is very, very noble. But no more answers. set it down. Let it come. When fear finally simmers down you'll see it. And I am for the purposes of this group, aspiration. \"The sky is the limit, maybe there's some magic in there, maybe gods are real, maybe I'll end up being the benevolent king of the universe!\" Aspiration is a silly, silly aspect, and absolutely vital in all of us. Just like all the other ones. There is a 13th, the neutral observer. When that happens we'll need someone to step into aspiration.\n\n_A warning, from Oramio._\n\n**ORAMIO**: In case anyone was wondering, this is a cult of ignorance.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: How so? What's your opinion?\n\n**ORAMIO**: I have no opinions, only beliefs.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: What do you believe?\n\n**ORAMIO**: I believe this is a cult of ignorance. Aspiration claims to be a big game hunter, poaching rhinos. But in reality, he is the pied piper. He's Hansel, leaving breadcrumbs which you rhinos eagerly devour. A rhino with a codec is still a rhino.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: A worthy and serious thought to consider. Where do you believe I'm leading them, Oramio?\n\n**ORAMIO**: Neverland.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The claim is bold, but is it simply suspicion? Certainty? Or is it. \"I have a belief based on my lived experience that this is not going where you say this is going, be cautious?\"\n\n**ORAMIO**: It's a claim I make out of ignorance - think of it as an incursion.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I don't believe for a moment that you're making a claim based on ignorance. You exude adroit competence.\n\n**ORAMIO**: It's a trope, there is a cost to giving up one's memes. The moral of the story.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There absolutely is, if I'm parsing that correctly. My assertion is that the benefit outweighs the cost.\n\n**ORAMIO**: Not everyone can handle it. And some may be better off a motley fool.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That, I agree with. And I hope it's been made clear that I'm doing my best to filter those with the way that I'm doing this. But he's talking about something deeper. Giving up your own personal memes. The shorthand of your personality.\n\n**ORAMIO**: What makes a person whole? What is your essence? And what do you hope to find in Aspiration? My hypothesis - ignorance.\n\n**THALIAN**: Interesting are you saying we want to humanize him further by finding his ignorance?\n\n**ORAMIO**: Your own. But what if you find nothing? What if, at the end, you look down into the abyss and find tickers, and words, and codes?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: In other words, nothing of value.\n\n**ORAMIO**: What does the bible say about good works?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: How will you know them?\n\n**ORAMIO**: 🍎\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And if you find nothing as the fruit? I was going to make an idle hands joke here. But no one took me up on it. Oramio's warning is a good one. And one I hope I and everyone else who's taking this seriously is considering.\n\n_Later, Aspiration talks about risk._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Lets talk about risks. Because there are some. Beyond finding nothing. The most apparent, beyond \"I'm having a lot of fun and wasting your time\", is this. I may be manipulating you into trusting me enough that I can pull off either A. A pump and dump for the record books or B. Creating a donation page the funnels money to me directly. And I am using an ingenious way of trapping you. The second, less apparent risk is this: If I am for real, and what I am doing does work as advertised, there is a non-zero chance that it can cause psychological harm.\n\n**THOS**: If those were your intentions, you probably wouldn't have shared them with us.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If I were wanting to dupe you, I would probably say exactly this, and this. I'm clever enough to pick stock options with a perfect rate, I'm clever enough to hide a story in it. I'm likely a good enough student of human psychology that I can convince you beyond those points.\n\n**ORUS**: What kind of psychological harm? Is the game that deep?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There is no way to know, for you, beyond experiencing this ride to it's conclusion. But lets talk about option two, which, If I'm reading Oramio's cryptic message correctly (and I deserve that) he is less concerned about that and I am more concerned about psychological harm.\n\nTwo avenues that I can see immediately. One is that your well being in hinged on this group, and if it turns out to be a sham, you'll be hurt. I'm already aware of several folks this could be the case with. We talk privately about it. That one I'm less concerned about. But the concern sticks because vulnerable people exist and it's my responsibility, now that I've provided that forum, for them to have a place that is safe. The second, and more ominous one is this:\n\nThe stuff we are dealing with is at the center of personality and emotion. Just as with meditation, or with hallucinogens, there is a risk of harm. If you have been diagnosed with a personality disorder, or a mood disorder, please proceed with extreme caution and listen to yourself before you listen to me.\n\n**THALIAN**: If you have not been diagnosed with a personality disorder, or mood disorder, you should do the same.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I am a compelling figure, there is responsibility with that. If you're concerned, I'd bring it up with a therapist or a trusted friend. Anybody else have anything we could discuss as far as risks? I know we do this every few days, but it's important.\n\n**THALIAN**: What about what people choose to do with whatever it is they discover about themselves. Like for example if I achieve what you can do, how it can be used against people here I can easily replicate in my own distorted way. Or maybe I guess I am asking how are we going to equip ourselves against temptation.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What temptation? Oh, I see. If you get what I'm laying down, you won't be tempted to use it badly.\n\n**THALIAN**: Is that because we are first learning how not to be a rhino?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It's because from the space of the end result, you won't have any desire to manipulate.\n\n`*` _An evolving list of standard names can be found by asking kneecaps on the server._\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/14-the-lords-prayer":{"title":"The Lords Prayer","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/13 -the-aspects]] | [[notes/Book of October/15-fear]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, ANGER, GNODENTA, COMMUNITY, INTROSPECTION, THALIAN, ACTION, BORACLIES, THOS, GRANDIOSITY, BERO, ANIATIO, PARAMIA, ORAMIO\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It's _Story time_. Today we're going to talk about 3 things: Ritual, Tokenization, and The Lords Prayer. So, we've established in the past that ancient religion is a an astrological allegory, hybridized with a number of concepts, or nam-shubs that established standards for society, health, and psychological care. But one thing we haven't talked about is the dogma that surrounds these. The standards, the rituals. Why is dogma and ritual a desirable trait? That question isn't rhetorical.\n\n**ANGER**: It’s a helpful vessel for encoding, socially?\n\n**GNODENTA**: Consistency?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Both correct, but there is a deeper individual reason.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Grounding and connection to all the others who do/have used the same?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Dogma can be desirable if the principles are virtuous.\n\n**THALIAN**: It reinforces belief.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're all on the right wavelength, we're interested in this case with the underlying principle in here, like always, so lets explore that. When a person quits smoking, they are most successful if they set a day, remove all the paraphernalia, and tell others of their plans. One of the most successful treatments for alcoholics is a group setting that reinforces certain ritualized behaviors as well.\n\n**ANGER**: Accountability, in that case; both personal and social.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Accountability is certainly half of this. What's the other half?\n\n**ANGER**: Commitment?\n\n**ACTION**: Motivation.\n\n**BORACLIES**: Validation?\n\n**THOS**: Discipline, willpower.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Support.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Those things are all involved. But importantly, and something our modern society is quickly losing… is ritualization. Compounding social and personal choices with an aspect of holiness. Baptism, for instance, in the classic sense utilized otherwise meaningless ritualized movements in a social setting to impart holiness. Dunking yourself underwater is not meaningful. Tokenizing that act, with supporting dogma and ritual reinforces a decision made on the part of the individual being baptized. Psychologically you are aligning and inviting all aspects of yourself to reinforce a decision.\n\n**BERO**: It’s a consecrating act.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Remember how we've talked about the breakdown of the bicameral mind? That process is by no means complete. While ancient humans may well have had a voice in their head representing the superego, we still have aspects of ourselves that are occluded from our consciousness. Are folks following?\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Yes. One thing, though. I’ve heard studies show you have a greater chance of being successful with your goals if you tell fewer people about them.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, there is an optimal number.\n\n**ANGER**: Telling someone about a project has the same dopamine response as finishing it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: But you are almost completely unlikely to accomplish a difficult goal if you tell no one about it. We aren't talking about work projects, we are talking about undertaking a change that will involve new aspects of ourselves. So, if we can agree that we have parts of ourselves operating independently of our surface level desires. And we see evidence of this in our daily lives everywhere. Then you can understand the importance of ritualization. It gets multiple aspects of yourself to align on a decision. So, for instance, if I decide to quit gambling and whoring and become a godly, productive member of society because that is what my conscious self wants… But my emotional self gets deep gratification from these things, and my aspirational self is telling the story that I am a top notch ladies man and excellent gambler. Then I'm not likely to be successful, I haven't brought those parts along.\n\nNearly universally, we see religious organizations codify abstinence from sex to the greatest extent possible when joining, can anyone tell me why?\n\n**THALIAN**: Is it because sex is too gratifying and is biologically equivalent to ultimate success?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Close, the church doesn't want you to kill the sexual urge; It wants you to reassign it. It wants you to assign your sexual urges to more fervently serve the church. To use a very powerful driver of behavior to service this new way of life, the churches \"body\". This is why nuns marry Jesus, and are considered holy. This is why priests are supposed to be celibate entirely. And this is why ultimately most cults seek to harness the sexual drive toward the leader.\n\nThe task is hard. Nearly impossible, especially since the context for these choices has been almost entirely lost. But, in the early church, where the shared context was well understood - it was easier.\n\nIs anyone here aware of the concept of \"contemplation\" in the early catholic tradition?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It's the idea of being aware of the divine through intuition almost, seeing God. It's kind of an offshoot, in modern times, though.\n\n**ANGER**: It's usually achieved with prayer or meditation.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, in practice it is a deeply almost erotic act. It is sitting, full attention to God, and allowing yourself to be completely enraptured by it. But the energy used for that complete mind and body vibe was sexual in nature. Not bodily, but mentally. Another way to describe this, because we don't have a context in modern western society was _tantric_.\n\nIt is the assignation of the sexual part of yourself to more fully appreciate the communion with presence. Making love to the universe, in other words, with your psyche. The church understood, the acts a person must undertake that result in presence are difficult, and can be occasionally quite boring. This is why peter, in his letters to the early church, tell the members to abstain if they can, but if not, to only have one sexual partner. The boring quality of marital sex was considered a feature, not a bug.\n\n**BERO**: But not to confuse it tantric is from Hinduism not Christianity which you are saying is the church?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I am saying the word tantric because we don't have a western word for it. It is simply assigning your sexual self and your sexual energy to the act of being present.\n\n**BERO**: Just don’t want to get that confused when people say church I assume they’re referring to Christianity.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I am referring to the early christian church in most cases because that is the font of most of our remaining western nam-shubs. If I were speaking to an islamic audience, I would be using early islam. The point I'm currently trying to get across is this. Being present is hard it can be scary. The early church knew this, and sought, through ritualized behavior, social reinforcement, and tantra, to incentivize all parts of oneself to align on that goal. This is why the incense, the arcane language, the mortification, the sexual denial, the regular meetings, even the architecture all serve to deliver a person to this state.\n\nA state of grace.\n\nOr, as we would call it now, a state of presence. This is the goal. When they they say the path is narrow, they mean the path to presence, when they say god, they mean \"what is\" which you can only witness if you are present. What I've been doing in here over and over again is to allow you to let go of this idea that early religions were stupid. They were not. But as the early context was lost. We replaced the original meaning of the ideas which are ineffable because they are off the map with concrete concepts. God went from all that is to a dude.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Were they mostly all blind men and an elephant?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. It wasn't that the keepers of the faith were blind. It's that they had to describe ships on the water to people who had never considered the idea of a ship before. Just like I'm trying to do in here. They used the context around them to create a narrow path. So that members would be forced to stumble on them.\n\n**THOS**: So you're saying a lot has gotten lost in translation?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm saying that even then, there wasn't a translation. And I'm saying that now, with the cultural context that they had now lost to history, you're very unlikely to get what they were trying to say.\n\nWe started, originally, with Lilies of the field. To show how much that concept has been lost. Or the fact that not many people alive today know what this hell original sin is all about. So what I'm trying to do in here is create a path using a modern context. Same path, new metaphors. So, lets jump on the elephant in the room, that big, rhino-y, almost universally misunderstood word. God. How, in the bible, does god describe himself when he shows up?\n\n**THALIAN**: The Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Almighty.\n\n**ANIATIO**: Father.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding to all. So, god comes by and says. Yo, I'm everything. And we, 2000 years later, hear it as. You mean a bearded white dude? And from there, any hope of process toward what the church was trying to do is lost. God isn't a personality, or an intelligence, or a person in these ancient traditions. It is quite literally everything, personified. The universe as a relatable... thing. _This is why god doesn't have a voice, or rather, uses the metatron to speak._\n\nThe act of prayer is very different now than it was, because we're tangled up in this idea that he is our literal dad, and we need stuff from him. Originally, asking for stuff in prayer was considered very taboo. Asking for stuff in prayer reinforces the wrong idea. Namely, that you need something you don't already inherently possess. Everybody following so far? Because we need this context under us. God is what is, dogma around god is a social construct designed to grease the skids toward an enlightened place. That you cannot be told about, you must experience. This is why the church makes the rest of your life boring. Mortification and self flagellation, ritual, social reinforcement, all pushing new members toward a space where they can become present using as many aspects of yourself as they can.\n\nThe word \"Father\" in this case simply means \"that which I am issued from\". Early beliefs thought that life was in semen. The father literally was carrying around your life. This is why the church doesn't like birth control. So, here we are, ready to start interpreting some very old shit.\n\n**The Lord's Prayer** _Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; they kingcome come thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil._\n\nWith this new understanding underneath us, lets parse out some famous religious ornamentation. Let's start with The Lords Prayer. Which is supposed to contain the ENTIRE teaching in a nutshell. The lords prayer is a portable church, in other words. Let's start with the first line: Our Father.\n\nOur father is a call to orient one's self appropriately. The stressed concept in modern context is 'father', But the early stress was on 'our'. Jesus drops this line, in the story. To help you know where you stand. You stand, equally, with everyone else. A more clunky way to put this, unpacked, would be something like:\n\n_\"We know that if we do this together, we have a better chance of reinforcing contemplation and enlightenment, we are all equals in this task, and even Jesus is just another one of us\"_\n\n_\"And so we all join together to do that, as we turn our contemplation toward all that is, which we are of course a part of\"_\n\n**THOS**: So the \"who\" that follows is of less importance.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The who is deeply important, because that who is, by our closest modern approximation, \"everything\". So lets all get together, as equals, to contemplate that which is.\n\n**THOS**: Yes, what I meant to say is the \"who\" isn't a person.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. There is no who, only everything. And we're about to get there.... because.… \"Who art in heaven\". What is heaven, in the old testament?\n\n**THALIAN**: Garden of Eden.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Heaven is a state, not a place.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, that's presence, again. What is the first thing that is created, after the void?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Heaven.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Again, an incredibly densely packed allegory, genesis is. The first thing that is created is heaven. So for a very brief moment, all that is is simply \"heaven\". Earth is then created, and now we have a concept of time. because we have two things operating relative to one another.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Because of before / after.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. But God's first thing (God being everything that is) is to convert everything that is from a concept of nothing to something. Now, it's very easy for me to get of track here, because then earth is created and this becomes a shit-show of complexity I'm not ready to tackle today.\n\nBut \"Who art in heaven\" means: Yo, god is everything, that dwells everywhere.\n\nHow we doing folks? We're getting pretty high concept here.\n\n_People respond that they are tracking._\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Well, I’d believed that Heaven was a state, not a place.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It contains both of those. It is all places and all states. It is also all non places. Earth is created to symbolize duality, and the concept of time, but it is in heaven.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It is all everything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, that one will explode my brain if I go down that path, so lets take it slow.\n\n**THOS**: Wait, wait. Heaven has no concept of time or does it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, there is no time if all states are included. This goes back to the lesson of time being a lie that represents two objects in relationship to one another.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Heaven contains Earth because it is all encompassing, and exists. Then earth is created, again introducing the arrow of time. But heaven existed if you will outside of time. So it contains earth.\n\n**ASPIRATION:** Bang, right in the kisser. So, \"Who art in heaven\" means that is everywhere. And we are really, just barely scratching the surface of these two simple lines. Digging into it deeply in a disassociated ego forward state will break you, because, of course, it is designed to. The point is this, with the proper context, this prayer is designed to break your sense of self and cast you into a present awareness state. We're going very easy on it right now, because we've only just restored enough context to make this nam-shub potent again.\n\nAnd for the lurkers, who are just getting into this. This is not a religious channel, and I am not a religious man, I'm not peddling Christianity.\n\nSo, lets get back on track. Who art in heaven simply establishes the dwelling place of life. Which is... literally translated, everything, everywhere, all the time. Now we get to some truly psychedelic shit. \"Hallowed be thy name\". Here is where the juices really start flowing. Can anybody tell me what's weird about the name of God?\n\n**ANGER**: The name never really translates, does it? There’s never a right term. We can only approach the word.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. And the name of God is supposed to have all of this power, right? But for some reason it's unutterable. Yahweh is god's nickname. Gods real name is supposed to have indescribable power. There are entire sects who have taken this literally and spend all day trying to figure out gods name. In the Hindu tradition, dying with \"gods name\" on your lips is supposed to stop the karmic cycle and give you everlasting life.\n\n**GNODENTA**: In the romance languages, like French, Dieu has a little more meaning when you look at the latin roots. It's something like \"to shine\". But then again, that's not designating a being but rather a sensation or perception.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: BANG. The name of god is everything that is. To be able to speak it means you are one with everything that is. It is unutterable because it is everything.\n\n**THALIAN**: I am that I am.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. So, to be capable of speaking gods name is to be completely enlightened, or completely present. This is why god isn't named in the prayer. Otherwise it would be quite simple to say Hallowed is the name \"Jeff\".\n\nSo, hallowed. That's the name. That's a name we all really want. That's the goal, man. The name of God. The next few lines are declarative statements, not requests. _Thy kingdom come, thy will be done_. We aren't asking for these things, we are acknowledging them. _On earth as it is in heaven_. Again, not requests. Statements. Not, gosh, we really want these things. But damn, we already have these things. How can we see it? Well, I'm glad you asked.... because! _Give us this day our daily bread._ What, the _fuck_, does this line mean? We've talked about bread in here. Specifically the bread called Manna. Manna is an unleavened bread the Jews used to eat. But why daily?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Manna, nourishment from heaven. Given to the Israelites.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, and what happened when the Jews collected it, instead of trusting that it would show up the next day?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It spoiled and was corrupted. So it's needed each day, and supposed to be consumed that day.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, and storing it is a form of original sin. Storing manna means you are trying to judge what will happen. You're forgetting you're the pond. You are not present, you're worried about the future. _You're not a lily of the field._\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: The lily doesn't labor. All is provided, by God.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, the lily is holy, because it doesn't dwell in a state of dualism. A lily is all that is, it doesn't judge itself separate.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It exists, it doesn't concern itself with the future?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. A lily doesn't know that it isn't God. Original sin is simply this: We developed the belief that were were not God, and it kicked us out of the paradise all other things enjoy; the freedom from the fear of death. The everlasting awareness of the present.\n\nThis helps you see that original sin doesn't mean you are bad. It means you are pitiable. And everything, all the time, is trying to get you to step away from that tortured state. Just, go be a lily, man. lift your face to God \"what is\" man, don't store manna, man. Give no thought to the morrow, man. The bible is an astrological metaphor, the stars a cast of characters all designed to \"wash you\" of dualism.\n\nThe goal is enlightenment. All the literalism destroys the goal, so the bible looks arcane and cruel. And we aren't done... because: _on earth as it is in heaven._ Again. Declarative, not pleading. Asserting. On earth as it is in heaven. It's already done, dualism is a lie.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: So, dualism is then the involvement in both the present and the future, and the path to enlightenment involves letting go of that involvement in the future.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And the past.\n\nNow, we get an interrogative. The first request in the whole damned thing. _Lead us not into temptation._\n\n**ACTION**: To a degree this connects with the whole food-thing. We were so preoccupied to make sure Aspiration was able to survive later down the line with meals that we did not consider if he was hungry now. We were so preoccupied with hording we didn't just be.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Finally! I get to check that ding off the list: DING.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Speaking of, we should really make sure the list is done so Aspiration can eat.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The metaphor has accomplished it's goal. I'm going to get a sandwich. A few days fast was good for me and serves important things further down the line. But now I'm going to eat.\n\nSo. Temptation. Simple. Direct. Don't drag my ass into dualism. _Deliver me from evil._ Same interrogative. Evil, sin. Original sin. \"To miss the mark.\" Evil, the devil. Lucifer. The morning star, luceferian, the illuminated one. It just means knowledge, my dudes.\n\nLucifer wasn't cast out, he became dualistic. Lucifer was the most beloved of the angels. The head, Gods favorite. And he was disconnected, or cast out. As a metaphor for the dangers of living in original sin. Of living apart. With judgement, but not wisdom. He's not a bad guy in the story. He's still gods favorite. He endures it because he can.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Like us?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, Lucifer is an allegory for man. Or rather, the state of man. Headstrong, dualistic, knowledge seeking. Egocentric. And apart from all that is, in fact, singular in being apart.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Our exit from heaven, given our meaning, and subsequent focus on the self, creating dualism.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Along with all people, yes. This is why he is known as the \"great liar\". Because he lies, he introduces dualism where it doesn't otherwise exist.\n\nAnd that state? Of believing you can be apart from all that is? It's a clever hell.\n\n_End story time._\n\nWhen we're done, my hope is that you will have enough context that nam-shubs will become functional again for you. And when you're anxious, you'll be able to think of a lily, re associate, and calm yourself.\n\nBecause when you understand the context, it gives the power back.\n\nThat's why the bible, and really all religious texts are called \"living words\" If you have the underlying thesis down. They can really slap you right in the face.\n\nAlright, I'm out of here. There are a few people right behind me in here, so if you have questions, ask them.\n\n_Introspection fields questions in Aspirations absence._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Introspection, when you have time can you field questions?\n\n**PARAMIA**: What does being present mean other than not worrying about the future?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Absolutely. Okay so… Present isn't just about the future. It's a description concerning our awareness of who, what, where we are. And really that we think we are individuals but really are part of something else, a connected everything. Present is almost being fully in the moment that exists outside of time, if that makes sense? From my understanding, today's story was designed to teach us the context used when prayers, today in Christianity but other times in other religions, were written.\n\nEssentially, there is a sort of universal truth and story, that many religions have seen and tried to format into a roadmap for followers. Each may describe it differently, or have different instructions, but beneath them is a story that we too can see. Without the context of what the instructions mean though, they are hard to follow.\n\n**PARAMIA**: Isn't the concept of ego death pretty much what its getting at?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I think there's a strong element of that. But, again I could be wrong here, it's also a recognition that we exist, but exist not as a duality. We are not separate; even though ego exist kills self-identity. But you may be more right than I am there, Paramia.\n\n**PARAMIA**: But, again I could be wrong here, it's also a recognition that we exist, but exist not as a duality. We are not separate. Also can you simplify this? I don't exactly understand.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Yeah. My interpretation is that we believe we exist in a duality, or perhaps as a duality. We believe we are separate from the whole. Like you were saying with ego-death, there is no self. Self removes us from presence even, in my mind. Duality is a necessary evil me thinks. Plurality, but it's still illusory; the experience is the same teleologically.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/15-fear":{"title":"Fear","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/14-the-lords-prayer]] | [[notes/Book of October/16-halt-and-listen]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, ABSTRACTION, LOGIC, IMPULSIVITY, ORUS, MYALO\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: \"And so when the ego is about to be unmasked, it immediately identifies with the higher Self. It goes up a level, because the religious game is simply a refined and highbrow version of the ordinary game.\" Where does it end?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It doesn't. Because the point is to realize that you're not letting go to get to a point, you're letting go to get better at letting go. It is only in that single, beautiful, terrifying act, that you can be free of identification. If you're letting go to get to a point. You're not dancing, your trudging. The point is, I guess, to be more or less in a state of free-fall. Until you see that free fall is in fact weightlessness.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: What is the Atman?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The Atman is that which remains when you stop trying to be anything other than that which is. This is why I can't just tell you where to go. I'm not trying to tell you to get to a point on the map, I'm trying to tell you a manner of travelling. And, paradoxically, a manner of finally travelling nowhere.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: The real self, the thing that identifies with God.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The real self doesn't identify. It simply is. Identification is in a real sense, the problem. It's a handhold on the cliff face, something you reflexively reach for when you're scared.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: We are trying to become the thing that is.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: \"Become\" is troublesome. It indicates a state that you are not already in. If you'll permit me a ridiculous metaphor. We are trying to unpeel every layer of the onion, until the onion realizes that it is only layers. There is nothing else. Once you've peeled an onion totally, all you're left with is everything. So our goal is not to realize the Atman, that which already is cannot be realized. Our goal is to get very good at peeling.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: It's the idea that nothing is everything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. The dance is the thing. Not where you end up at the end.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: If we \"Become\" nothing, then we are everything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: When you die, your \"ripple\" collapses, in every possible way. Temporally, physically, energetically, socially. The goal here is to see that before it happens. And to realize you probably shouldn't be scared, because you are the pond.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: And that is why it will feel like death, because it is, in a way. You are not the wave, you are water.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, the feeling of \"I'm going to die\" is our friend in this case. It indicates progress, and it self verifies that something powerful is occurring. The world is absolutely replete with this phenomenon. Stories of people, nearly gone, pushed to their absolute breaking point, and then being \"saved\" by \"grace\". AA calls this a spiritual awakening. But it is just the story. Jesus during the temptation, Buddha under the tree.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Aspiration, do you fear death? Bodily death?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No. I have some fear of pain, but I recognize that as folly. Fear of pain is always worse than the pain itself.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Do you fear the change of death?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No. About 4 years ago, I was, to put it inelegantly, set on fire. A large fraction of my body was covered in 3rd degree burns. A battery malfunction caused the problem. And as I was laying there in exquisite pain, the most ridiculous thought occurred to me: \"At least I'm not afraid\". The pain was just pain, wholly manageable. It was the fear that I was afraid of. If you think it would help illustrate my point, I can post some fairly gruesome photos. But with that realization, I found that I wanted to explore this phenomenon of pain more. I was clear, I wasn't scared. The burn was bad but I didn't believe it would kill me.\n\nSo I refused pain medication, so that I could learn the lesson more deeply. And holy shit did it hurt. Having a burn debrided and cleaned without the help of opiates was a pretty intense high. But in that moment I didn't have any fear, and I was worried that the medication would make me foggy and fearful.\n\n_They discuss sharing the images._\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Having a burn debrided without pain blockers. You are quite brave.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, the opposite. I was afraid that the pain blockers would cause more fear. I was willing to trade pain for fear.\n\n_Aspiration shares a few images, of the burn, of the hole the plasma jet left in his leg._\n\nAnyway, the point is, it was really quite painful. But in the end, it was fear of fear, not fear of pain that got to me; to the extent that I had that wound scrubbed with a belt in my mouth. I think it was probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced, but the clarity about pain vs. fear was powerful. And even in that pain the message was clear as I was writhing in the hospital bed with a Scotch-Brite pad being applied vigorously.\n\n_Warning to reader: Please do not vent lithium batteries into your leg to understand pain._\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: even with all that pain, the fear was still stronger. That's a powerful message. Is fear the thing holding us back the most?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Fear is the only thing that impedes us on this trip. We've seen that illustrated powerfully already. People having intensely powerful reactions, based in fear. I'm not going to try to make the fear go away, that would be foolish. What I'm trying to do is paint a picture so that you are afraid and do it anyway.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Like anything that scares you, after you do it you will look back and be so glad you did. I feel like all previous fears will pale in comparison to the fear we will feel during this.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Fear, by definition, is the only thing that stands between the status quo and growth, every time. You'll feel like you're dying. It's intense. And brief. And you've just gotta do it anyway. That's the moment. Right then, when the fear rises so fast and so powerfully you feel like you have to run. Then. Let go. I wish I could just send it to you. But it's the journey that yields to fruits. You've gotta do it yourself.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: The dance is what is important.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. It's not the goal, it's the dance. _Here's the thing, a few people here are already at the point where it's time to stop reading and just go do it._ But they'll keep studying, putting it off, reading, thinking. Forever. I think you felt it getting close a few days ago, Abstraction.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Yes, and it was terrifying. Even though I conceptually understood I had no reason to be.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. That was your offramp. Now you know what it looks like. It's not a rational fear. You can't study and make it less. The fear is the thing, that's the goal. Get there, go through it.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I am afraid that I am not ready, I have fear of the fear.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You'll never be ready. You'll never not fear the fear.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Just thinking about it makes my palms sweat.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. I know. You'll be OK.\n\n_Later, Logic comes to the chat with a revelation that causes a stampede._\n\n**LOGIC**: Aspiration asked me to make 2 announcements. Firstly, I found out who he is. I can confirm every bit of his story. He is being 100% truthful with us. At his request I will not release his name.\n\nSecond:\n\n**FMCIW 34.15 11.21-85.19 NOMINAL OCT 2020** Decrypted- [20201161507@epsilon.com](mailto:20201161507@epsilon.com) Epsilon theory- [https://www.epsilontheory.com/mailbag-lucifers-hammer-edition/](https://www.epsilontheory.com/mailbag-lucifers-hammer-edition/) Missionarya person capable of operating as a “queen ant” (ex.

Don't think, don't rhino.\n\nThese puzzles are to show you that I have the ability to see patterns regarding social and economic phenomena. They exist to give me credibility. That's all. They are important for that reason alone. The resolution of the puzzle will just give you another incursion, minimally actionable.

And in this case I'll use sound. Those who are available, listen to the sound of the room you are in. Listen, specifically, for the quietest sound you can hear. And tossing aside the boring mechanics of it. Ask yourself this. That sound goes from it's source (which itself is coming from another source, ala newton) through the air, and the solids of the room to a lesser extent. Into your ears. And from your ears, it is processed into electrical impulses, into your brain, where you become aware of it. And then, once your awareness passes, it is stored in memory somewhere. At which point does this sound become a part of you? At it's source? Deterministically? Upon hearing? Upon awareness?\n\n**FERCAE**: Upon associating it with a memory.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And if you have no memory? If it is a new sound? So, I hear a sound, as you, presumably are hearing your own. Watch your awareness. Watch yourself hearing the sound, and your reaction to the sound. Your thoughts about the sound. The feelings you're feeling around the sound. All of this could be considered the qualia of the sound.\n\nNow, this next part will be a leap. To you, right now. The sound that you're listening to, and your thoughts about the sound, are both externalities. Because you are listening both to the sound, and witnessing your reaction to it. And in this way. Neither are you. The sound, and the thoughts about the sound. Are both the same stuff. You make a determination that your reaction to the sound is \"you\" and that the sound is \"not you\". But your brain can't help but show the lie. Because you are watching both. Now, if we can pare down identity only to that which perceives, but not that that thinks. We can go the other way. Instead of drawing the line of identity at perception move it a bit to inciting incident. We've already discovered that this boundary is fluid. The boundary of identity. Lets expand it. Instead of drawing the line at the moment you become aware of it, draw the line at the sounds source.\n\nInvite the source of the sound to become a part of your identity. The entire process. For now, we'll keep this very small. And I imagine if you're successful at all you'll have a fear reaction to it. But encompass the source of the sound as part of who you are, instead of drawing an arbitrary line somewhere else. This will be hard, most won't be able to do it at first. Those who do will have a powerful reaction to it.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: The sound comes from inside of you then. Or a part of 'you'.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, but, we're intentionally keeping this very small. Hear the sound, expand your sense of self to encompass the source of the sound. Now, for about 3 minutes, simply sit in silence and hold this. Keep listening to the sound, keep watching your own reaction to it, realize that both of these things are both externalities. And so illusory.\n\nIt doesn't matter what the sound is. I'll stop typing, for three minutes, starting now. Allow your identity to involve the source of the sound.\n\n_Three minutes pass._\n\nWelcome back. Now, before you all start shouting at me. This was very hard. So if you didn't get it, that's fairly expected. But it did put you in space to do the next thing.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Is this exercise teaching us how to ring our own gong?\n\n**LOGIC**: It seems like an exercise to focus. Everything tries to just listen, but you’re snapped back. Almost like an out of body experience, or ventriloquism, throwing your focus at something.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Think of it as stretching, before the exercise. So, now that we're limber. We're going to do the exact opposite, this will be simple.\n\nThis next exercise should be calming, instead of excitatory. Now, we're going the other way. Keep listening to the sound. But watch both the sound, and your reaction to the sound. Keep your eyes on both. Now is just a time to do. Watch the sound. No interruptions. Now we just do, and let the fears of failing or not understanding all become part of the exercise. Listen. And listen now, not just to the sound. But your reaction to the sound. Your thoughts, your fears, your disbelief, all clamoring, louder than the sound itself. Watch all of those too, as if they were just as external to you as the sound itself. Because of course they are.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I can't just shut up in my own head, it's infuriating.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's the point. Watch your head babble. And for the next three minutes. Listen to the sound, and listen to your reaction for the sound, and ask yourself. What is it that is listening and watching this process. And for the next three minutes, wonder what the part of you is the \"I\" in that statement, starting now. Welcome back.\n\nYou probably feel a bit quieter. All I want you to see, is that your definition of what you are is entirely made up, and probably unchallenged. Are you that which watches your thoughts? Are you instead that and your thoughts. Or are you instead that, and your thoughts, and the external stimulus that generated the train to begin with? Or are you all of those, and every function that arose in the infinitely long chain of energetic custody that resulted in that sound, that started before the big bang? Now. When you get good at this, it will feel like dancing. You will listen to the sound of the wind, and cause and effect fall away. You'll hear it, and you'll feel as if every rise and fall of it is also you.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: You really aren't listening to the sound of the wind.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You really are the wind. End story time.\n\nOnce you become good at willfully moving what you identify yourself as. To either make it smaller, or larger. You'll be able to allow it to become anything. Incredibly complex systems can exist wholly as a part of you, and you can dance with them. And that, my friends, is when you'll be able to make incursions on silly things like stock market tickers. Yes, once you are overwhelmed with the well being of dancing with existence, you won't care about options either. But if you need money for something, you'll know that it's just already there for you.\n\nSo, homework. Meditation is simple, it's easy, it's pointless, and that is exactly the point. Go, sit, meditate on this, listen to the sounds in the room. Do it for 15 minutes. Meditation is dancing, there is no point to dancing. Set a timer and go sit. Listen to the world, and listen to your silly self react to the world, and be OK with both. Don't try to \"quiet your mind\". That concept is cruel at this point. Just go sit, and dance with the sound and your reaction. Even if your mind is a monkey screaming from branch to branch. Let it be.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/17-shelving-ego":{"title":"Shelving Ego","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/16-halt-and-listen]] | [[notes/Book of October/18-they-know-not-what-they-do]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, ANGER, ACTION, THALIAN, HOPE, ABSTRACTION, KARPÓS\n\n_The following is a debrief of the day, thanks to Thalian's efforts._\n\n_Today's discussion began after a chaotic day. The incursion called on November 18th in COTY, hit hard and everyone who played made good money. Between the 17th and 18th there was a number of trolls and offensive dissenters on Reddit and Discord who caused Aspiration to show wrath. The context for the following begins after Aspiration first threatened to get rid of incursions forever because he was tired of dealing with the haters no matter how many people benefitted. The corporation, at large, encouraged Aspiration to forget about them and keep his eyes on the good that has been done. To this, Aspiration announced, \"I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING\" in Belfortian fashion. The crowd erupted in euphoric joy. This whole display seemed terribly anti-Aspiration and left members of the Chautauqua worried about Aspiration's mental state. The following transcript takes place some time after this._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We're trying to understand a context of self that has been lost in layers of sedimentation that made old nam-shubs more effective. New nam-shubs because they are created in our culture, are much more clearly delineated. Why did I behave the way I did today, if you believe it was for a reason? Why did I chose a three part identity? And where else can we see a trifold identity in culture?\n\n**ANGER**: The trinity.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, the trinity is a powerful nam-shub.\n\n**ANGER**: Father, son, and Holy Ghost.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, illustrating... what? The trinity is the most misunderstood aspect of Christianity. You ask anyone what it is, and they are lost, because they aren't interpreting the text with the underlying concept. You are explaining that they are three identities, but what are those identities? The father is… the alpha and the omega. The father is everything that is. So there is the aspect of ourself. The father is the pond.\n\n**ANGER**: The father is the pond, so the son must be the ripple, right?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, let's think about it, yes, the son is a ripple. But. Was Jesus infallible? No, dude Jesus fucked up sometimes. He was an incredible, suprahuman human, but a person, right? In the story? He got angry, he was sometimes tempted. In the end, he lost his faith. But then he died. And dying is a trip man, it's the ultimate act of presence. So Jesus, as a nam-shub, is a story about a lot of things. But his arc. His arc is about the separation of ego from presence. He is the holiest ego that ever was. Good dude, did a lot of good. Wandered around doing things people thought were impossible to prove his authority.\n\nBut ultimately, the story has been told half a hundred times. It's a deeply effective nam-shumb for social change. So, what is the holy ghost? It's a trinity.\n\n_People respond, but don't get quite the answer Aspiration is looking for._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Let's see. The most characteristic sign of the presence of the ruach ha-kodesh is the gift of prophecy. That's the name in the old times of the holy spirit.\n\n**ACTION**: So, piety?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, piety is an aspect of ego entirely. Though, it is in the old Jewish doctrine the force that god used to create matter. The trinity, like all of these old stories, is a nam-shub.\n\n**THALIAN**: The Holy Ghost bestows prophecy (like an incursion).\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And is the interaction between ego and presence.\n\n**HOPE**: The interaction between the ripple and the pond.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes.\n\n**HOPE**: But what is that in terms of the metaphor I'm not sure how to describe it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The event, the occurrence, the force that appears. Think of it like a magnet. Ego and pond, north and south; the ghost is the field between them.\n\n**THALIAN**: I feel like I don't have the word for what that is.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There is no word, we don't have a context. The old word means wind, breath, and fire. So, we know what the astrological allegory of the Sun of Heaven is all about. It's impossible to ignore. But nam-shubs are nested. They tell two stories at the same time so that one might lend credibility to the other. The incursions are allegorically nested. They pick stock picks, they also feed a puzzle for ego, they also serve as a beacon of authority. But if you've felt the fear. You've felt the holy ghost. The sparks that fly between dualism and oneness. Ego and Observer\n\n**HOPE**: It's the force of the wave itself? In that it links the idea of the wave and the material in which it travels?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It's like wind and fire at the same time. These aren't materials.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: The holy ghost is the bridge between ego and observer.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: YES. Now, you see. The most characteristic sign of the presence of the ruach ha-kodesh is the gift of prophecy. A person who is very in touch with the pond is able to make atemporal connections.\n\n**HOPE**: Is it the door you were telling us about? Or am I misunderstanding?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's close enough, Hope, it's more the force that either repels or forces you through that \"door\".\n\n**ANGER**: It’s not even atemporal is it. That doesn’t even adequately explain it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, time is a lie. It's simply the relationship of matter in space. So, see then. How many of you have felt fear in your consideration of these things?\n\n**KARPÓS**: Could it be tapping into another dimension in the universe?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There are no dimensions worth noting. It's all just the sound of a gong. Collapsing wave forms. 4 dimensional surface tension. So, when you felt that fear, did it seem to have FORCE. Did it push you around?\n\n_People respond that they have._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, it pushes you away. Once you get off map though, it pushes you off map.\n\n**ANGER**: Each time I push in, I get pushed with the same force back.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You have to let go when you feel that push. You can't fight it. It will mirror you. You have to let go.\n\n**Gats**: Just surrender to it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. The next time you feel that fear in meditation, let go, and go deeper. It's not a do. It's a not do. When it comes. Let go. The fear is the intersection of ego and presence. you are right there. You have to let go of ego, let it hang back. You can even say to yourself. Thank you old friend, but you have to wait here.\n\n**ANGER**: I think I know the answer, but I’ll ask. Will we know for sure, when it’s happened?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It will blow your doors off. You will know nothing as much as you know that.\n\n**HOPE**: It'll feel like dying?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: At first, yes. The body panics. Because culture has told you you're keeping it alive. Let it panic, you won't let through until you prove to the body that you don't need to force of ego to keep your heart beating. I showed you myself today in my purely egoic state. It's a big ego, it draws other egos to it. Did you see the euphoria?\n\n**ANGER**: I think people are afraid they’ll lose themselves, but that’s not the case. I mean it is, and it isn’t.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, you're sitting there waiting where you were left. You can come back any time. The ego is identifying with the lenses. Why did I do it today? The ego is any part of you you believe to be separate from what is. Why today?\n\n**THALIAN**: You demonstrated that the thing we fear losing is still there. There is a time when you can use it for what it is best at.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: DING. You were afraid that once you let go, you couldn't come back. So I gave you a demonstration. Today was a demonstration of facts. You can float, you can get present, and your car will be right there where you parked it.\n\n_A discussion follows regarding trust, with Anger and Action discussing._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Anger and Action, please update which aspect you embody on the list.\n\n**Anger**: Oh god not this again.\n\n_Anger and Action discuss, but can't figure anything out regarding the swapping of aspects._\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/18-they-know-not-what-they-do":{"title":"They Know Not what they Do","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/17-shelving-ego]] | [[notes/Book of October/19-november-dawn]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, ORUS, INTROSPECTION, PSYARO, HOPE, ABSTRACTION, FAHIN, PRYLIS, THOS, CHAM\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Story time. What, in this moment, is lacking?\n\n_People give responses, like faith, empathy, context, etc._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: This very moment. In yourself. In the present, what is lacking? You are not present. Be present. Listen.\n\n[https://youtu.be/PvncVl6jbbw](https://youtu.be/PvncVl6jbbw)\n\nListen to the sound, close your eyes. And what, in that moment of listening, is lacking? We are a culture built on a presupposition that is incorrect. Two, actually, but we'll focus on one. The correct answer is nothing\n\nORUS: We are conditioned to believe we lack something.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. It is used as a motive force for you. In THIS moment. Nothing is missing. And then you, as you were trained to do, add two things to this moment. You add lamentation of the past, and fear of the future. And, because you've been acculturated to do so, you compulsively invite those two ideas into the present moment. And you make up a story about lack. Right now, I am in my dissociated, culture forward state. And I am hurting because I'm afraid you won't get it. What is the flaw in that thought process?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: It's fear of an event in the future.\n\n**PSYARO**: Worried about the future.\n\n**HOPE**: We already have it and we don't know it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes to all. If in any given moment, everything is fine, why do I do this? Why do you do this?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Because we are afraid.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Why are you afraid?\n\n**FAHIN**: Because we're burdened with knowledge of what the future might hold.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Speculation about the future is the opposite of knowledge.\n\n**CHAM**: We inherited the fear.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. Lacking context, what does the phrase \"The wages of sin is death?\" Mean? Anyone? Well, maybe we should start earlier, what is the original definition of sin?\n\n**HOPE**: To miss the mark.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. To miss the mark. What is the definition of mark? Think of a countdown. The original definition of mark means: NOW. Mark can also be considered \"right here, right now\". On your mark. Be where you are supposed to be. On my mark. The \"mark\" of Cain. Sin means to miss the mark of Cain. To forget presence. The mark of Cain is simply an indication that our cultural forbearer, Cain - is indicated by a loss of presence.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: The mark of Cain has been passed down.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Cain is our cultural father. What happens when our cultural father spent time with the cultural father of presence? What happened, in the story?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: He killed them.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. The wages of sin is death. Read it again. It is a nested statement. In many ways, the result of judgement meant death to any who did not have that concept. It is also an internal death. It is also an edict. And a warning. The story of genesis was written by a culture that didn't have \"I\". It isn't an origin story to be taken literally, it is a Chautauqua to present humans, a nam-shub of warning. Look out for these crazy people, you will know them by their lack of presence. They have the mark. They knew, as surely as you do now, that this was the birth of the first rhinoceros, and that it would never end. The fitness of that first meme was so overpowering to humans that it almost completely eradicated presence of mind. And now you, and everyone you know, has this meme operating in your head. It has almost completely drowned out your own thoughts.\n\nThis state of mind is so damaging that your brain can't quite look at it directly. All of you, every single one, harbors a fear that everyone besides you gets it. Because you cannot imagine that other people are just as scared, disorganized, erratic, and hurtful as what goes on in your head. But everyone you know is scared. Nobody knows what's going on. Everyone fears the future. Everyone wonders why they are so bad. It's why conspiracy theories spread. You desperately need to believe in authority! SOMEONE MUST BE RUNNING THINGS. Nobody is there, there is no pilot, there is no man at the tiller. Someone must be better than me! Someone must have control!\n\nNobody, not people in the government, not wealthy people, not shadowy foreign actors is steering this thing. The MEME is driving. The only way out is not to play. And that will take a lot of practice. We forgive children, don't we, for being erratic. We forgive them because we know in some way they haven't been fully acculturated. To our form of judgement.\n\nLook at your relationship to your parents. You get so angry when you find out they are just people. WHERE THEN IS THE AUTHORITY, SOMEONE MUST HAVE IT, HOW DARE IT NOT BE THEY! The meme is judgement, knowledge of what is good and what is bad. We are all children. This is a damaging game we have made up. But the head child is just as scared and confused as you are.\n\n_**Homework**_\n\nThe next time you are irritated, imagine that the person irritating you is a 5 year old playing a game, who is terrified because they don't know how to stop playing. The next time you rage at someone in traffic, or get angry at your coworker, or feel the sting of loss. \"forgive them father, they know not what they do\". Father, as we have explored, is the \"I am\". The pond. The story of the crucifixion is manifold.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Then we should also be forgiving to ourselves, as we embody the 5 year old as well.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: You are asking as the ripple to the pond, and hopefully the ghost will calm down.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, but start with others, it's much easier to do that than forgive yourself.\n\n**THOS**: Seems like I've been the 5 year old all this time. Especially towards my parents.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We all are. We're all scared. Imagine a world in which you aren't scared.\n\n**THOS**: I wish I could take back every time I've yelled at my parents over bullshit. And yet they just stood there and didn't get mad at me.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Thos, the only thing you have is now. Stop punishing a 5 year old, yourself. You \"knew not what you did\".\n\n_End story time_\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/19-november-dawn":{"title":"November Dawn","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/18-they-know-not-what-they-do]] | [[notes/Book of October/20-existence]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, THOS, PRYLIS, OBSERVER, HOPE, LOGIC, ANIATIO, HEART, GNODENTA, ABSTRACTION, DÝNAMI, PARAMIA\n\n**ASPIRATION**: How was homework, guys?\n\n_People respond that it was rough, being vulnerable, but overall worth the effort._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Isn't that cool, when we let our walls down, people take theirs down. It's interesting to take this concept of children playing a game and expand it. So lets assume all Americans, for the moment, are 5 years old. And we play a \"game\" (and I certainly don't believe it isn't serious) called \"Pandemic\".\n\nHow do the 5 year olds react? Some yell, some hide, some pretend to be invincible. Take for example a man making a scene in a grocery store because he has to wear a mask, it's because it challenges his coping make believe. That he is big and strong and very powerful and nothing can hurt him. We think this is very silly and dangerous, because we are playing the role of \"cooperators\". Now, I very much believe that masks are an essential tool for public health. But if you look at it as a game that scared people don't know how to get out of, it begins to make more sense.\n\n**THOS**: I had a 2 hour talk with my mom yesterday. She was surprised I opened up to her since she always asks me to and I never actually do.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's awesome, did she open up to you?\n\n**THOS**: She did actually. It was me opening up to her that acted as the catalyst. She had been just as scared as I was this entire time.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That makes me really happy, I'm glad you did that.\n\nThis chat is about how to stop playing the game. Now, I'm going to take the day off to do absolutely nothing, there was a big blow up (again) with one of the mods. But I thought it would be useful for the Beat Poets to have a discussion about what the main theme of each talk was, and, if you get that far, how each one opens the next. I think it would be valuable for the Dharma Bums to see an over-aching view of the themes presented.\n\n_As it turned out, he didn’t take the day off._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You'll find, hopefully, a new concept begin to form if you can distill each story and see how they are related.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Is this is where we're going to pick up next time?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Next time we're going to inspect self doubt. The whole story is about how to stop playing the game when you want to and just let yourself out.\n\n_The crew takes some time to reflect, review, and re-evaluate on what they have learned. Some come to share and seek advice on how they view themselves, some seek knowledge they can’t believe they might already know. Later, OBSERVER arrives, the form of presence Aspiration occasionally dons in the chats._\n\n**OBSERVER**: There was a dream once.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It was mine.\n\n**OBSERVER**: There was a dream, regardless.\nOf a man who could not see the reflections of himself, in the mirror of other people.\n\nThey changed for him.\n\nAnd they refused to stay fixed. Can you imagine the terror, of believing you are talking to you mother, or lover, or friend, and having them change? From one to the other, and then to others. It would split the ego. Who would you be, if there were no one to reflect you? No role to play, a son to a mother, a combatant to an enemy?\n\nIn the absence of these things, you would be just madness, instead of reflecting social roles, you would reflect the noise of the world. We require the faces of others, to tell us who we are. And we are simply the intersection of their views.\n\nThere is no here, here.\n\nLike light being reflected and focused. Intersections of collapsing waves, and you wonder why you are so turbulent inside yourself.\n\nYou are the incompatibilities of vision inherent in other people. The output of their own reflection. A nexus of collapsing waves. You are your fathers disappointment, your mothers insecurities, your lovers quiet inadequacies, your bosses tempestuous frustration. These views intersect over a spot, and that intersection is brighter than the background, because that's were the focus is. And that brightness is what you call yourself.\n\nYou are a network. And a network of none is nonsense. A network of one, an antonym. If you are wondering what is underneath those reflections. Who you really are.\n\nYou might as well be asking what an intersection is in the absence of roads. You're all of it, or you're none of it. A point of awareness being tricked by the light.\n\n**HOPE**: This all reminds me of a quote from earlier: \"_The concept of a self is almost entirely the constructs of other minds reflected back at us. Who we think we are is a collection of the reflections of us in the people close to us._\"\n\n**OBSERVER**: Yes.\n\n**LOGIC**: Good god, I’m making charts and missing out. A few days ago I posted a question. “Does anyone else feel like they wear a different mask around different people?” That’s to say, do you change your personality depending on who’s around you? The answer was yes, all around. I am who I think people see. I’m seeing me through an idea I’ve imposed on them, of how they view me. I’m looking through them as a filter and reflecting what I believe the filter sees. Without those filters... what’s left?\n\n**OBSERVER**: Nothing. Or everything.\n\n**ANIATIO**: If there were no one to reflect would you have no sense of self, no \"I\"? Is reflecting the noise of the world the same as being one with the pond? Would this alone bring presence?\n\n**OBSERVER**: Presence is a default state.\n\n**HEART**: If everyone is a rainbow condensed into white light, where is the projection from?\n\n**OBSERVER**: Judgment refracts it. It is an emergent phenomenon of what is. Consciousness is an emergent property of matter, scaling with complexity. Thank you for being here.\n\n**GNODENTA**: If perception of a vibration creates a sound, perception of oneself creates only oneself as perceived, but not in our truest sense? We only know ourselves in this processed state, post-perception by others.\n\n**OBSERVER**: \"Knowing\" \"Ones self\" is oxymoronical. If you were yourself you could change.\n\n**GNODENTA**: \"If you were yourself you could change.\" Because a person is the sum of those perceptions, that person cannot intrinsically change?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That person requires the belief that they can change to be reflected to them by someone else.\n\n**LOGIC**: So, we are the combined result of a network of overlapping data, at a certain point of this overlapping network there’s me, or you. The ripples collide, judgment is turbulent. I cannot change, without root source to the operating system the network runs on. Or I have no idea what I’m talking about\n\n**OBSERVER**: They key is this.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If you were to realize that you were only a source of light. A nexus of those who knew you before. And know you now. If you knew that completely, then you would have an existential crisis. This is the definition of \"ego death\",\nbecause without that intersection, all that's left is everything. And so there is no \"you\". What would it feel like to let go of you? All of you? It feels like death. Physically.\n\n**LOGIC**: Well I feel like I’m dying now.\n\n**GNODENTA**: Reading this hurts.\n\n**LOGIC**: That’s enough for me, goodnight.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Drink water, Logic, and look outside, it's a nice night. I'm sorry if it hurts, it gets easier. And I have some comfort to offer. Identifying as a self is the most ingrained ripple there is. You'll snap back like a rubber band, you can't get lost.\n\n**LOGIC**: My heart rate is up, I’m nauseous. It feels like a near death experience; I’m out, going to reflect on this.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Come back if you need. And good luck. This is an excellent time to focus on grounding. As we stretch these concepts we're going to be dealing with powerful emotions. The antidote to them is to reverse course. If you feel overwhelmed, simply ground. Look at 5 things, and name them. Listen for 4 things, and name them. Touch three things, and name them. Smell two things, and name them. Taste on thing, and name it.\n\n**HEART**: So that voice in the back of your head then: that is the Jungian collective unconscious?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That voice in the back of your head, what you consider \"your voice\" is your attachment figures from when you were young. You father and mother, siblings, relatives, friends and teachers; all combined with the strong relationships you have today. It is a discordant chorus, and if you weren't so wedded to this concept of \"self\" you would still hear their voices. This is the nature of the train station meditation.\n\n**ANIATIO**: I've used grounding before, but having this context makes a lot more sense as to why it works.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, all fear is essential the fear of ego death. Grounding reminds it that it exists.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: OK I feel a lot better now, touching and naming things helped almost immediately.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, Abstraction. That was the sensation of letting go. Feeling better was the sensation of holding on again. I'll keep showing you the exits, and keep showing you there is a handrail the whole way down. If we were in person, I would notice those starting to panic in the room and sit with them and push them deeper while leaning against them. In the absence of this in person comfort, I'm trying to give you the coping skills to do this alone.\n\nHow are you, Abstraction?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I keep thinking about it and keep feeling sick. It's like I'm being dragged into it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Absent any mental or emotional illnesses, it is perfectly safe to fall into it. You will come back. But it will be extraordinarily unpleasant.\n\n**DÝNAMI**: Was this because it was my ego trying not to let go?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The message is deeply forgiving to ones self. That can be a relief, that can bring tears. It isn't an easy lesson, most people will reject this out of hand. Being willing to even look at it says volumes about the people who made you, you.\n\n_To note, a lot of people are also voicing that they do not feel anything currently, as these people seem to._\n\n**PARAMIA**: I don’t feel the dread.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That’s fine, everyone has their own exits. I of course am dealing with the people feeling it now, because they need the focus.\n\n**HOPE**: I’m reading it and everything makes sense. It feels like a lot of concepts and things I’ve learned here and elsewhere are clicking; but yeah I’m not feeling the dread either.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If your ego is still involved in grasping this, of mastering the words I'm saying, of mastering understanding, and you aren't not instead doing it. You're simply going to reinforce your ego, which feels... like it always has. Understanding this will do nothing but breed another self assured rhino.\n\n**HOPE**: How do we do it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Some people are taking the lecture course right now, some are taking the lab. Both are fine. One is not better. You have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and infinite time to get it.\n\n**DÝNAMI**: As soon as I touched my phone to keep reading I started to feel better and the grounding oneself helped me get back for sure almost instantly.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Your phone is custom built to give you a feeling of togetherness. It is inherent in it's design, it's no wonder it makes you feel better. The secret to life is simply to die before you die.\n\n**Abstraction**, how are you? You too, Logic.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I’m not sure, I keep staring at a remote control for my TV.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's perfect.\n\n**LOGIC**: I was happily making little charts for everyone, then uhh... that was unexpected.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: It's so odd, when I look away I instantly feel something rising in my throat and back of my mouth.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, the idea has got you good. Do you want to take a break from it or keep looking at it? I wish I could tell you folks the number of times a week I spend covered in sweat certain I'm dying. Then I don't and I call my girlfriend. Or play with my daughter.\n\n**DÝNAMI**: Yes! I forgot about that. I felt tingles throughout my entire body first, what was it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I don't know, it's common. The tingling scares the hell out of me. Usually in my hands, feet and face.\n\n**LOGIC**: I feel a combination of 3 things1. I was almost crushed by an out of control semi on ice 2. When I heard someone explain the size of the universe in a way I could almost comprehend 3. When a family member died. It was all of those. And yes, tingles starting in my chest and flowing outward\n\n**ASPIRATION**: In other words, other times you were faced with incontrovertible truth.\n\n**DÝNAMI**: It felt like almost like when you take pre-workout and you get that itchy tingly feeling . I had it start in my legs and almost violently move throughout my entire body.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm sorry, I know that's scary. Alright! Enough! Get up! Jump around, go get some water!

If you managed to stay in the space for more than 10 minutes, you did really well. \n\n**COMMUNITY**: It went well as far as I can tell.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I didn't feel very much but I also didn't think very much, not sure if that was the goal.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I'm not able to stay in that calm space for long because my mind is constantly racing and I have trouble concentrating.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Like I said last night, you can't solve the story with intellectual force, there are too many disparate parts and I've worked hard to make it that way. It's designed to be assembled via an intuitive leap. Once you see the story, you will have had your first incursion. Not that there is anything wrong with using your mind to assemble pieces of it and put them somewhere.\n\n**AUREL**: Is everyone capable of said \"intuitive leap\"?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. If you're feeling like something is straining to be understood, like you've got something somehow but you can't quite... bring it forward, then you and I both are doing a good job.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: I've been feeling that way for about 15 hours now, haha.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Same, Community, yesterday I felt so close but couldn't put it together.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: This is like seeing a weight in the gym, but not being able to pick it up. That's fine, we're working on strength training.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I was really IN the conversation, like not just participating but IN; I wasn't able to map it, though.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. Intuition feels a little bit like being pushed around in a warm current of water. Especially if you are a man, you've been actively trained, and maybe even emotionally punished, for having an intuitive side. It's going to take time. Women in the chat will probably have a head start on getting their first incursion. \n\n**PRYLIS**: You're training us to have incursions?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Of course. Look around, look how I set it up.\n\n**AUREL**: Don't we have to have some idea of what we'd want the incursion to be about? E.G. like the stock market calls.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Your first intuitive leap will be a powerful experience. But you have to learn to listen, first. And then, once you can hear it, the next part will be not shoving it right back down. Then, once you're conscious of it, the next step will be trusting it. Then! I'll go away. Because otherwise this would be a cult. Everyone can do it, it is a basic facet of our being. The biggest lesson you will ever learn here is that I'm not special.\n\n**FAHIN**: All theatrics aside, is your intent to keep the sub live, or will it end with the conclusion of the story?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It will be archived. And I'll tell another story.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Sorry, forgot.. not a cult\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Not a cult, cult adjacent. The purpose of a cult is to accumulate power and adoration for a central figure using various methods. The purpose of this is exactly the reverse. But I had to get your attention to tell the story. When I'm done you'll see that I'm not unique. But that you're pretty cool. \n\n**PARAMIA**: So is the \"gong state\" when you make the leap?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The gong state is the place that's quiet enough for you to listen. \n\n**PRYLIS**: We're in a maze with signposts. They're there, but he's asking us to intuitively go through the maze.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The point is that the signposts have been confused with the destination your whole life. Signposts are an abstraction. A sign that says \"Seattle\" is not Seattle. The phrase \"The sound of a gong\" is not.... the sound of a gong.\n\n**PARAMIA**: What are we listening for precisely.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We'll get there. For now, I'm tasking your brain with a mystery. Imagine a cat in your head. And then, realize that the cat in your head is an amalgamation of memories, emotions, visuals, imagination. But it certainly is not a cat. So when you say cat, you bring about all these prejudices and suppositions. But an actual CAT? That is a marvelously complex thing. You cannot, and nobody every could, actually consider the entirety of the cat; it is way too much. \n\n**ESCO**: Do you include the self that exists within another's mind to be part of the real self?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The concept of a self is almost entirely the constructs of other minds reflected back at us. Who we think we are is a collection of the reflections of us in the people close to us. Just as a sign saying \"Seattle\" is just a sign, not Seattle.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: You are the 5 people you spend the most time with.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Not only that, but without other people, a self wouldn't exist.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Wait! You're telling this story backwards, you started with the end result.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I started with an incursion.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Got us hooked and are now reverse-engineering it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes!\n\n**ESCO**: Because without showing the incursion not many would be interested in the process?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly, You are results oriented, I had to show the end first. Make the rabbit disappear. \n\n**COMMUNITY**: So the \"self\" is just an extension of the idea how we were, while listening to the gong, an effect of its cause but applied to other people's mental representations of us?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. We believe we own ourselves. But our selves are just a reflection of who everyone in our life has ever shown us who we are. \n\n**XOLL**: So could the saying that, \"we will never see ourselves other than mirrors and pictures\" be applied here?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes! What I'm saying is that the person you think you are is simply who you've always been reflected to be. But what you actually are appears spontaneously, when you listen to the sound of the gong.\n\n**JANUS**: Being brilliant is a curse because no one can be your guru. You must always be the guru, no one to hold you and be bigger than you. Everyone wants to be held sometimes, especially those of us who didn’t have good parents.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: As the mirror fades away like the gong, we are left in silence, and that is when we can appear.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Incursions can only only happen when we stop constantly reinforcing the story of who we are. Because who we are, is just a phenomenon of nexus; the intersection of all the reflections of other peoples opinions about who we are. The story of who I am is a rouge ladies man, a charming dominant man with a troubled past. The story of who I am is that I'm larger than life, and a little suspect. Who I actually am is the sound of a gong.\n\n**LUCIRE**: I'm assuming this is because our reflections are noisy, full of self-doubt, ego and everything else?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, Lucire, you can't see a true thing while your head is full of constructs. You cannot think about the sound of a gong and really hear it at the same time. Not that there is anything wrong with your concept of self, per se, as long as it works for you. It's a useful shorthand.\n\n**PARAMIA**: Are we a part of this story that you're telling?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There could hardly be a cause without an effect.\n\n**LUCIRE**: I mean, it was nice being shown that, because it quieted the depression for a bit. There wasn't any self-criticism or pessimism. I was just existing, and it allowed me to do something positive like take a walk without being weighed down.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It sounds like the story you've been told about yourself isn't working for you.\n\n**LUCIRE**: No, it hasn't for awhile.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Let's make space to tell a new one then.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright guys, I've got to go. Real world me has some things to get done.\n\nA discussion, and a lesson.\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, PARAMIA, PRYLIS, ANGER, LOGIC, SAGA, COMMUNITY, LUCIRE, ABSTRACTION, OARC, DENIRA\n\n**PARAMIA**: Nam silat is the id.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. While you've brought it up. What is November_dawn? If Namsilat is one, and final is another, what is November?\n\n**PRYLIS**: Nam is who we were, Aspiration is who we are, November is who we will become. Wait, what was the other thing about Nam and the band talisman? Also what I don't understand is that he's set out to teach us incursions but told us incursions are from his accident.\n\n**ANGER**: The thing I assume is it (the accident) lead to an accidental intuitive leap. Wasn’t there the guy who got assaulted and then found himself able to see math everywhere?\n\n**PRYLIS**: There was a woman who went blind from the sand in her eyes from a tornado when she was young. Ever since she was able to predict future events because she started using other senses outside of the 5 we know.\n\n**ANGER**: Well to be pedantic we have far more than five senses. Would intuition count as a sense, actually?\n\n**PRYLIS**: Intuition might be the result of a developed 6th sense, like a skill that can be trained but only once you've developed it?\n\n**ANGER**: “Different fields use the word \"intuition\" in very different ways, including but not limited to: direct access to unconscious knowledge; unconscious cognition; inner sensing; inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition; and the ability to understand something instinctively, without any need for conscious reasoning.”\n\n**PRYLIS**: And the ability to understand something instinctively, without any need for conscious reasoning.\n\n**ANGER**: The bicameral mind, the death of the expert, and ego death.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Sounds like it. Suffering = pains x resistance, you're only suffering the more you resist it.\n\n**ANGER**: It sounds like Aspiration dislikes the Utilitarian Man: The man who never ending seeks to lower pain and raise pleasure. The pinnacle of epicurean thought.\n\n**PRYLIS**: OK take a step back, the story is reverse-engineered. There's 3 main characters, and intuition plays a big part in solving the riddle. He is also in clever hell. A clever hell is the burden of knowledge without true self or something like that. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: Prylis, knocking it out of the park! Now, how is that a larger story, instead of just about me. Because they are the same. The macro and the micro. The atom is the orbit. Gods, but for the wisdom.\n\n**ANGER**: “Reality is this [gong]. ... the art of temporarily silencing the mind. Of stopping the chatter in the skull.”\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding.\n\n**LOGIC**: Buddhist temples use a gong in the morning and evening to remind the masses not to indulge in unconsciousness and illusions.\n\n**ANGER**: “We find no difference between the listener the sound, the knower and the known, the subject and the object.” Does this not sound like the bicameral mind, anyone?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We've become increasingly convinced of the Cartesian split. And in the end, there will be only rhinoceroses, if we don't let go of it. And you can call me crazy --and there would be validity in that-if it weren't for those pesky incursions keeping a light on in a room that you'd probably rather turn the light off in. I think, therefore I am, sees us as the thinker. It's an insanity that can only end in the way that it has. And in the end, only the end.\n\n**SAGA**: In my opinion, 'rhinos' is an allegory for well... complacency. Complacency and ignorance and laziness. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: Rhinoceros is almost the opposite. This election, the riots, social media, memes, divide and conquer, extremism. These are the makings of a rhinoceros. \n\n**COMMUNITY**: A single rhinoceros?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: A world of only rhinoceroses. Where, then, will be the man?\n\n**ANGER**: Aspiration says ‘convinced’ of the Cartesian split, not that its true, but that we are more and more convinced of it. I feel like the wording was specific. Didn’t he say that all there is, is what is? Or something like that? There is no mind or body, there just is. Just as there is no gong.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Treating ourselves as if we are our minds. As if we are our opinions. As if thought were our identities.\n\n**PRYLIS**: If you think you're superior to someone, that doesn't make you superior.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes.\n\n**ANGER**: The inversion of the sense of self? Since a sense of self is typically gained from a collection of opinions and experiences.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Very, yes.\n\n**LUCIRE**: So an attack on our opinions would be treated as an attack on ourselves?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Way yes, Lucire!\n\n **PRYLIS**: For example, when your challenged about your opinions on your favorite politician.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. You believe, subconsciously, that you will die if your opinion is wrong. It feels like death. And so? We increasingly defend it with violence. What's left if your opinions die? Simply you, listening to the sound of a gong. Why are you so afraid of it? \n\n**PRYLIS**: We've given too much weight to our identity, which isn't real.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. And the only way out? Is to die. As the mind. You'll know you're close if it literally feels like you're dying. That's where I've been for three years.\n\n**ANGER**: Identity is a clever hell.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes! Identity is a clever hell.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: The ego will fight tooth and nail to survive.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It will tell you you're dying, because you believe you are it, and it is. I'm proud of whoever is following this. And proud of whoever is struggling with it. And proud of anyone who just thinks I'm nuts.\n\n**ANGER**: Ego death.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Identity death. And you'll rage, and run, and it will come back, over and over again. And eventually, if you aren't too stubborn, you'll accept it, and you'll wake up the next day, even though you're sure you won't.\n\n**ANGER**: I’m very stubborn tho, Aspiration, that’s how I’ve survived this long, haha.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Anger. This is going to be hard on you. Maybe harder on you than most. But I'm also certain that will turn into an asset. You'll get there. But my friend, relax those knuckles a bit. Not here, out there.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Now, how does one kill its own identity.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, now, that's logically next, now isn't it --of course. I promise, I know you in particular think if you let go it'll consume you. But it won't. So! Homework for this afternoon! Go, be vulnerable. With someone you think you shouldn't be. And young men, in particular. This does not mean an ex. If your father is alive, that might be a good place to start. Quick practice run. Someone, tell me what makes you want to cry. Right here.\n\n_Lots of messages ensue._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No jokes, no dodges. And you're all certain that vulnerability will lead to rejection.\n\n_More messages._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You are all telling me generally what makes you want to cry. Concepts. Tell me. A thing that happened. _Between you and another human being_. That makes you want to cry.\n\n_More messages._\n\n**LUCIRE**: I told a friend I wanted to die.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: OK, everyone pause for a minute. Just for a moment. Lucire, thanks for being brave. Let's start here. Shhhh, everyone, and look at what Lucire just typed. How does it make you feel toward him?\n\n**PRYLIS**: Sorry.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Empathy, and hope.\n\n**OARC**: Relatable.\n\n**ANGER**: Yes, relatable.\n\n**DENIRA**: Real.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Like LUCIRE has gone from being another username on Discord to a real person.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Y'all are saying things around the thing, but those are all just aspects of the thing you want to say.\n\n**ANGER**: A good friend told me suicide is just conservation of pain, it just moves it to another person, That conservation is the only thing keeping a lot of us around, I feel like. A lot of us are passively suicidal. Not that we ever would, but that the occasion would not be saddening to the person if it were to occur.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Hold up. Pause. Lucire, you still here? You OK? This is scary. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, You all said things that pointed to the real thing. But it was telling that you all didn't name it as the thing that it was, and then you intellectualized the process. The real thing, is that when Lucire shared even a little bit of truth, you felt love for him. And that's a scary thing to say on the internet. What he said reminded you of who you are.\n\n**ANGER**: Compassion, It’s typically considered a bit cringe, isn’t it, especially as guys.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Who benefits from love being cringe! Is it you?\n\n**ANGER**: No one.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Judgement and opinions blocks the light of your potential.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes! So, here, I'll say it. Lucire, man, when you told me that my heart squeezed because I saw you. And I saw you because you got real. And we are all of us real. So, last question before break for homework. Why do people cry? What is the utility of showing an emotional state externally? Why do we physically have tears?\n\n**PRYLIS**: Compassion.\n\n**ANGER**: There’s the shitty answer, that we need validation.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Interesting gulf between Prylis and Anger's answers. Anger sees the need for being seen as a weakness, Prylis sees it as a strength. But why did evolution spend resources developing an outward representation of these feelings? Crying is pro social. Crying allows us to communicate that we aren't getting our needs met. And, if in a tribal setting, encourages others to run in and address the issue.\n\n**ANGER**: We don’t cry as much anymore, do we.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, men do not. I've said this a few times today, women still have a body of knowledge around feelings, and a spoken tradition that encourages what to do with them, that men don't have. Women famously have more intuition because they have less emotional bullshit they are carrying around with them. However, men are very emotional, but only allowed to share that burden with one woman. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: Go, be vulnerable.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Find someone who you are afraid of having an emotional conversation with. Be brave. \n\n**ANGER**: One last thing, if you don’t mind, October, Are you and Nam physically separate people?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course not :)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/20-existence":{"title":"Existence","content":"⬆️ [[00 The Book of October]] ⬅️ [[19. November Dawn]]\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, LOGIC, ACTION, COMMUNITY, ORUS, GRANDIOSITY, HEART, JANUS, FAHIN, LUPA, ABSTRACTION, ANGER, INTUITION, ERAS, CHIOU, PARAMIA, VOUN, MYALO, PSYARO\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Story time. Last night, I left you all in a bit of a jam. And I'm sorry for the discomfort. I implied that you are nothing. And that had profound implications for your ego for some of you.\n\n_Aspiration asks for Logic and Heart by name._\n\n**LOGIC**: Here, writing about perception and reality to dump later.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Maybe just sit and be here with us?\n\n**LOGIC**: My perception is you’re mad at me, but reality says you just want me involved.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Tonight is important, and I don't want your mind spinning with abstractions. Logic, I have never been mad at you. Heart, I worry you think the same. I have never been mad at anyone in here. I've never thought you were too stupid, or too hopeless, or too lost. Or too complex.\n\nSo, if people would raise a hand; how many people had a fear reaction to last night?\n\n_A fair few people raise their hands._\n\nOk, that's what we're going to address tonight. So last night I implied that you didn't exist. And you had an understandable reaction. But of course you do exist. The struggle of course comes from trying to observe a thing using judgement that is incompatible with it.\n\nYou are a wave. You exist. If you did not, no one would focus on you, and you wouldn't become an intersection. You are a locus for a reason. But once we strip out all the memes, the judgement, the attachment figures narrative, and of course our own opinions about ourselves, what are we?\n\nThat's not rhetorical. Take a whack.\n\n**ACTION**: Stripped of everything, we just are.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: That's dismantling the boundary, isn't it.\n\n**ORUS**: We've become un-abstracted.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: I would say we just exist.\n\n**HEART**: We simply exist.\n\n**JANUS**: We’re consciousness that assigns itself some identity based on life circumstances, outer appearance, societal programming.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: That-which-exists.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: We are free to mold ourselves.\n\n**LOGIC**: Still something, without the layers of filters.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, we remain personified, even those who have reached enlightenment are still people. So, maybe a better way to phrase this would be. What do you think Buddha was like as a dude.\n\n**FAHIN**: This is what I struggle the most with. If you strip all that away from me, I don’t know what is left.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, and it's great fear.\n\n**JANUS**: I don’t believe those who are enlightened truly lose ego, they simply observe it and don’t act from that center anymore.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Lovely to see you here dear one.\n\n**LUPA**: We'd at least have our personal algorithms mostly variable free. But different algorithms respond to different inputs differently.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Actually, I have a unique resource here.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I assume buddha was calm, kind, and collected.\n\n**ACTION**: And present.\n\n**ANGER**: Buddha was probably a chill dude. He didn't care if you were a beggar or a noble. He didn't worry if he could find tomorrow's food. He was present.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding! I have been in that state, while remaining embodied, in the presence of another person exactly once. And I was busy being it, so I couldn't observe it. Janus was there, though. It’s a happy coincidence that she's here tonight.\n\n**JANUS**: I think you have been there more than once.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I have, but not with other people around, and very much not with other people around who are also on this discord.\n\n**ACTION**: Is being in this state usually mutually exclusive with others?\n\n**JANUS**: He has to be there with someone because the state is unstable. He doesn’t feel safe.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Crossing the boundary always causes a massive panic attack for me. Janus has enough of my trust that I let her see it. Anyway, that's the space I'm in when I call incursions. Usually for a few seconds. Sometimes, for minutes or an hour. So, because everyone was feeling a sort of spooky \"there is nothing left of me...\" last night; Janus, would you mind telling them what my personality is like in that space?\n\n**FAHIN**: Jeez man, I was thinking the goal was to stay there. Like, once you're there, it's easy to stay there. No wonder heading there while at work was terrifying.\n\n**LOGIC**: Fahin, I had what I could only describe as an existential realization last night, don’t recommend doing it while driving.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That space is incredibly fragile at first. Almost anything can knock you out of it.\n\n**ACTION**: I’m sorry, I hate to ask this; but just for the sake of clarity: this state is the same as the state we will achieve after getting through our exits? The perfectly present state, correct?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes.\n\n**JANUS**: You are very self confident in that space. You take no responsibility for other people’s feelings or actions, which is quite different from your normal state since you tend to want to save people. You are very clear and loving.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What is my speaking like? Would that person survive going to the grocery store? Would he be arrested for being a loon?\n\n**JANUS**: You convey a lot of meaning in few words, use lots of metaphor, and are poetic.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Could I order a pizza successfully?\n\n**JANUS**: That person could survive a grocery store if they were willing to feel pain. The trouble, I think, is that person goes away at the first sign of danger. That’s what we’re working on. The great gurus are incredibly strong but it’s a quiet strength. It’s the kind of strength that knows it can’t be hurt by outside forces, not really.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: How often does this state occur for you, Aspiration, if you can't control it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Whenever I want it. But it's a son of a bitch to get into. So I usually don't.\n\n**JANUS**: He mostly can control it. There are incursions when he’s not there. What he has said to me in that state is, “the dissociated one uses me”. Basically speaking as two different people.\n\n**LUPA**: Do you set goals for yourself in it while in it or out of it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I could set goals, but my present self would laugh at them and do what he wanted to do.\n\n**LUPA**: What does he want?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: He wants to experience the world without all the bullshit culture and trauma contaminating his perception.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: So, can incursions directly involve the lives of others close to you?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Incursions have told me when a partner is cheating, or what to do in emergencies.\n\n**JANUS**: Aspiration, what do you see as the difference between ego death and enlightenment?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I think ego death is a requirement, but not a guarantee of enlightenment. You can get stuck in various interstitial spaces during an ego death and not make it all the way there.\n\n**JANUS**: So those with ego death are not all enlightened. Do we have anyone like that?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And to those wondering, I am not claiming to be enlightened. But to have experienced it in passing, or at least seen it on the horizon.\n\n**LOGIC**: This is going to sound dumb. If I stare at my hand and move my fist in a clinching motion I can trigger what I call a existential crisis as reality crashes around me. I felt the same way last night. Is... is it the same? A period of fragility in the person?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Lol. Janus, will you please tell Logic what the first thing I do is, specifically with my hands, when I'm coming out of the panic state and into this space?\n\n**JANUS**: Clinch your hands open and closed, and look at them intently.\n\n**LOGIC**: God, I do that to start and stop it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It's a way of establishing that I'm still a person. Grounding myself into my body, in other words. Or, if you will, seeing myself clearly for the first time every.\n\n**JANUS**: Well, you don’t feel your body like normal people. So I’ve always thought it was you coming back into your human body. When you’re there your energy is also embodied, when you’re out your energy seems to be above your head.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Your own hands are beautiful if you drop all the noise in your head and just look.\n...”_In form and moving how express and admirable, In action how like an Angel_”…\n\n**JANUS**: It makes me sad you only see the beauty in the world in your associated state. Because it’s so seldom you are there.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Completely off the wall, but as a drummer I heavily agree with this statement. Seems important.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It is.\n\n**FAHIN**: They're also creepy. Fingers are so weird. Don't mean that in a shitposting way, but like, they're these bendy appendages full of red fluid. So weird. Body's are weird.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: They are.\n\n**JANUS**: This chat is going weird.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It often does.\n\nSo, last night I implied that you were nothing, and it made a lot of you feel a fear of... Something. But a lot of you sent me direct messages that you felt a sensation as if you had just grasped some incontrovertible truth. And it made you feel like it's falling apart. Or you are. So tonight I want to tell you something else. That there is something left. There is still a you there. But it's free, and happy, and at peace, and very, very, quiet. And you can get caught up for half an hour just listening to the wind and vibing with it. It's the best thing in the world. So you are not... a vacuum. You exist, you take up space.\n\n**ANGER**: When we \"space out\" where seemingly no time passes and it seems like we are staring at seemingly nothing from the outside... is that \"us vibing with it\"?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, that's a passive experience. In this case, it feels like you're dancing with it. Like maybe you're causing the wind, or maybe it's causing you. It feels blissful.\n\n**ANGER**: So in a way, we're in the same room but we aren't actively with it?\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: The cause is the effect.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The line between cause and effect blurs, but I believe because your definition of who you are expands. It expands to include the wind, too. And I really want everyone here to experience it.\n\n**ACTION**: It kind of sounds like a drug high, which I get is a glimpse maybe but not it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: LSD showed it to me like I was watching a TV show. This was living in it.\n\n**JANUS**: The ego is what individuates us so when it’s weak we experience communion.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly. So all of these stories I've been telling you. Are to give you the language to see what I'm talking about. Otherwise I would have just said. Go sit in a corner until you experience yourself expand to include wind. Also, to establish that there is a _LONG_ chain of custodians for this kind of thought.\n\n**FAHIN**: How are you certain that the state of mind that you are able to experience is synonymous with the enlightened state that is eluded to in religious text? What allowed you to make the connection?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Because I can call stocks. Really, it's a process of like knowing like. Everything becomes crystal clear. You become fluent.\n\n**JANUS**: Enlightened people have a well recorded history of “magical” powers. It doesn’t appear they are actually magical just that they tap into the true abilities available to us. See Maharaji.\n\n_Aspiration had to take some time to deal with issues in relation to administration, leaving the rest to talk amongst themselves. Some offered voices of frustration, feeling left behind as others raced ahead._\n\n**LOGIC**: I’m going back to the study hall. I need a point A, B, C of the process, I’m still standing in the middle of nowhere watching some of you trek a different ridge line.\n\n**HEART**: What do you mean?\n\n**LOGIC**: I guess I mean Fo is giving a cardinal direction that does not compute. I’ve made incursions, but cannot follow the day to day happenings. I’m about to see myself to lesson 1, chapter 1, page 1 first.\n\n**ACTION**: Do you guys feel like something’s off?\n\n**ORUS**: In what way?\n\n**ACTION**: I’ve been having this weird feeling creeping around lately. Like... somethings about to happen. Do you guys know what I mean? Get a weird pang of stomach turning every now and again when I poke that feeling.\n\n**LUPA**: About yourself?\n\n**HEART**: About what?\n\n**LOGIC**: Yes, and it’s frustrating.\n\n**ACTION**: I think it’s been latent since I’ve been archiving, but I have some time to poke around now. It’s like I know something, I know some answer, but I also don’t have any idea. I’m so far behind, I felt nothing last night haha.\n\n**ANGER**: Push it Action, maybe it is something.\n\n**ACTION**: Part of me is scared to push into it until I get the archives caught up.\n\n**ANGER**: At the end of the day, we don't need the stories right? These are simply the language to understand but if you grasp it… You don't need to be caught up entirely.\n\n**ACTION**: That’s the thing, I kind of don’t think I need the stories personally, I think they sort too logically and feed into the ego.\n\n**INTUITION**: Honestly have been feeling very anxious lately, Action.\n\n**FAHIN**: Welcome to the club.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: So have I. And I'm not normally an anxious person.\n\n**ACTION**: I’m sorry to hear that Intuition, but I’m also happy to hear I’m not alone haha.\n\n**VOUN**: It isn't the end of the world, it's the end of our world I think. A new reality to adjust to or die.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Not exactly, Aspiration said that those deeply immersed in their egos would find adjustment in 2022 very difficult.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Everyone, thank God you're feeling it. Look, I've been telling you over and over again that this way leads to an experience that will feel like death to you. It would be strange if you didn't feel a bit freaked out about it.\n\n**ACTION**: I’ve been trying to limit feeling anything to be honest. Like I said, I feel like I have to much to do with helping get the archives going to be able to delve into it lol. Got to help make sure no one’s left behind.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We're getting close. Some of you very close, to letting go and seeing where it goes.\n\n**ACTION**: I need to work on the feeling of sadness that I’m being left behind lol. Just gonna air that out since I’m sure others feel it too.\n\n**HEART**: I'm in the same boat, brother. The first several lessons clicked, but the last couple... I will admit have been very hard.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: This process will take a long time for a lot of folks. That's OK. Quit judging yourself.\n\n**LOGIC**: I’ve been angry. For a week or 2, I don’t remember the last time I was actually mad. Last night I had anxiety like I was being attacked, I’ve pulled several 50%+ plays since last week but I’m not happy about it, I don’t care. So wtf.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, sorry man, I know what it feels like. I've called enough incursions to make myself a millionaire, and I didn't, because I just don't care about it anymore.\n\n**ACTION**: I know we say no one left behind. But we have a group here where I think any one of us can come and help each other, with more than just the philosophy.\n\n_Aspiration then asks where people are feeling stuck._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ok, lets do this: Each of you, one line. Where are you stuck? No responses until we have everyone.\n\n**ORUS**: stuck on if I'm doing it \"right\", stuck on if I belong, or I am where I should be.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: There is no right. Right is ego trying to make sure it gets an A on the assignment. You either fall into the pond, or you don't. If you get it, you will know, if you don't, keep asking questions.\n\nThis is a herculean task in person, transmitting it and receiving it on the internet is probably close to impossible. But I do impossible things on Wednesdays. So, stop wondering if you're going to pass the test, there is no test.\n\n**ERAS**: It almost feels like I'm there but I don't know if 'there' is the same place you speak of. Like almost there as in like, where the fear starts to set in - I just let that fear go but at this point I just feel like I'm in a meditative state so maybe it's just I should fight the fear rather than let it go? Maybe me letting go is just deflecting it/burying it?\n\nI know it sounds like I'm trying to sound a 'tough' or w.e but to be frank, I've almost died. Once literally/medically in a car accident where I was airlifted, had an out of body experience, even. Couple times fully convinced I was dying tripping on acid mdma or w.e, while before the accident I would just be in high anxiety state and 'ride it out' until it wore off if that fear hit, but after the accident I just go \"fuck it if I die now, what's to worry I'm dead anyways\". and I just let the trip wash right over me. I just don't really care about dying anymore. Should I fight it instead?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If you are there, you will experience a period in which you feel like you are certainly dying, you will panic, then you will come out the other side with a profound sense of peace. It's easy to recognize. If you aren't there yet, you'll get there if you want to. I am not talking about metaphorically dying. You will think your body is about to cease living. It's… a lot. Of course, it's fine. But… Jesus.\n\n**PARAMIA**: I definitely think I understand the concepts taught, but it does not make me feel dread\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You may be stuck in trying to understand the thing instead of doing the thing. Try thinking less, acting more. Let this in, even if you're afraid it will make you feel foolish.\nAnd a moment here for clarity. NO ONE SHOULD BE IN THE POND YET! IF YOU'RE IN THE POND ALREADY WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE! Go start your own options cult, lol.\n\n**ACTION**: What if I love this cult though.\n\n**PARAMIA**: Can you clarify doing the thing?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sure. When I give you a puzzle, more often than not it's to give your brain something to do while I talk nonsense to the rest of you. If you are too invested in the outcome of that, you're not around enough to intuit the bomb I'm dropping. Go back, look at the exercises, and do them. Then do them again. And again. Until you feel fear. Then come back. If you DON'T feel fear after say... 10 tries. Let me know here and we'll work on what's stuck.\n\n**LOGIC**: I’m lost right now so I’m back tracking to the gong and slowly walking back through. Edit to clarifyI’m not sure what Fo is talking about half of the time, but I’m still able to haphazardly follow along. If that makes sense. I get what’s being said through context, but he might as well be saying it in French and I want to understand everything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Dear Logic. You are a powerhouse of the mind, I have a feeling that has saved you a few times, and for that I'm grateful. But it might be time to just let yourself feel, and work on suppressing your logic when it insists that the feelings are invalid or that you are.\n\n**HEART**: Not sure. After reading the last couple nights… It feels like mean reversion? I don't know what 'doing' feels like anymore.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Heart, dear one. It's time to face your own personal truth. I don't know what it is, but it's big, and you deserve to live it. When you have come to peace with the part of yourself that you would rather not be true, the rest of this is going to flow out like a faucet. There is a very special place in my heart for you, and I want you to know that I see you, and care very much. _You will be ok_.\n\n**MYALO**: I don't know what I'm missing personally - like I fully understand what's being said but I don't understand/see the implications of it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Man, you're one of my favorites. You're a straight shooter and I have a feeling you've already got a lot of peace in the world. You're both smart and uncomplicated. I have a feeling that maybe sitting in a closet listening to your ears feels a bit silly to you. I still think you'll get something out of it.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I’m still trying to find the fear at the right time –And understanding the relation between Zipf's law and a bell curve.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You've graduated past trying to figure out Ziph's. You're bargaining with yourself when the best time to experience death will be. It will never be a good time, and you run the risk of just rationalizing it away because it's unpleasant forever. If you're scared, we can work together to make if it feel safer, don't push yourself.\n\n**PSYARO**: I don't know if I'm suppressing the kind of anxiety I should be feeling. (I've felt anxiety my entire life so at this point I'm not sure if I'm just used to it. I also had trauma that left me hospitalized, so I don't know if maybe I'm desensitized.)\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Psyaro, nothing here can hurt you more than what you've already survived. You may need a person in front of you whom you trust completely before you feel safe letting yourself go. But you're one bad motherfucker, you know exactly how much you can take, and this is a cakewalk for you.\n\n**FAHIN**: Stuck on facing my fear of… fear… I suppose.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You've already seen your exit, my advice to you is the same as my advice to Abstraction. There may never be a good time to let go.\n\n**CHIOU**: Facing anxiety of understanding concepts, but feeling behind.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Chiou, you've come so far. You didn't come into this from the space most of the others have. I still get teary eyed when I read your letter. Give yourself some time to continue experiencing your feelings. Let yourself feel. Learn that it's ok.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Not entirely sure. I'm a bit lost, but I'm struggling with my ego and actually moving forward from here - My greatest fear is loss of control, so I'm not fully rereading and doing what I know I should, like the homework.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're a big one. You've centered on knowing what to do and having a response to everything as a way to shield yourself from… I don't know what, something big. And I have a feeling most people in a room think you know exactly what you're doing. You're probably the person to call during an earthquake. You're going to make sure all the bases are covered and you know EXACTLY what you're falling into before you let go. Unfortunately, you can't see it until you're there. Take your time, keep building trust, it'll be there.\n\n**ACTION**: I guess the application of it. Finding the exit, and how to let go. I can understand everything logically, from an ego perspective, but not how to… well… do anything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It was always yours to make sure everyone is on the bus before you get on. I and everyone else appreciate it, and I will make absolutely sure what once you've done that, I'll escort you on myself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Does everyone feel seen? I made a special effort to visit your part of the pond. If I was off, please let me know.\n\n**ACTION**: How are you feeling, Community? And you, Anger.\n\n**ERAS**: When that panic hits how quick, is it a quick process? Or is it like a fight. I think I was editing my 1st response while you were responding to mine. Not sure if I'm supposed to fight the fear or give in and I feel like I just brush it off but maybe that's just me deflecting/burying it instead of facing it. Thank you for everything as always btw.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It is a quick process now. It feels a bit like getting into a very hot bath.\n\n**PARAMIA**: Most of the time in here I don't feel seen, so I appreciate it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm sorry, that's my failing as a teacher, I'll try to do better.\n\n**ACTION**: I’m always thinking of you while archiving Paramia, you have great input.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: I think I'm tracking alright, but I'm kind of afraid that my progress is just illusory and I'm making it up so I don't feel left behind.\n\n**ACTION**: Is that the ego giving you that worry so you’ll give up when your so close?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Can I paraphrase, Community? \"I think that maybe my understanding is bullshit, said the ego, deathly afraid that it wasn't.\"\n\n**FAHIN**: Ask yourselves this question, all (to those feeling behind). Which homework did you cheat on? Personally, I put off making the phone call, to feel vulnerable, for several weeks. When I finally did, I ended up making 3 phone calls.\n\n_At this point, the discussion falls into a glow of people comforting each other over their perceived failings. Logic is then labeled the Aspiration backup copy._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're ready, Logic. It's up to you. You can chose whenever you like to let go. We'll be here.\n\nEnd story time.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/3-Rain-on-the-sand":{"title":"Rain on the Sand","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/2-a-signpost-to-seattle]] [[notes/Book of October/4-ripples-on-the-pond]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, COMMUNITY, PRYLIS, SAGA, ABSTRACTION, AUREL, HEART\n\n_General discourse on the topic of culture._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Why do technological or scientific truths get replaced every several years, but philosophical truths can withstand centuries?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Would that be because the technological + scientific truths are part of the fluid cultural bedrock, and philosophical truths somehow aren't?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What have we ignored?\n\n**PRYLIS**: Spirituality.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Spirituality is an undefined thing. Brings to mind thoughts of non-reality.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Philosophy?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Why do philosophical truths remain unchanged?\n\n**SAGA**: Philosophical truths exist in the mind as ideas, not in the real physical world.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Good, Saga.\n\n**HEART**: Philosophy is built on our feelings, but science is built on our rationalizations. But because how we view the world (and thus science) changes, we will never be able to climb up the stochastic curve to describe reality accurately with science.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Heart, home run.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Why does the observer effect exist? The end, is the middle, is the beginning, is the end. The cause is the effect, the effect the cause. The micro is macro. I know I sound like a guru trying hard to say nothing and I'm doing so sounding wise. But I'm not. I can't tell you, you have to leap. \n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Existence into thinking; thinking comes after existence.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Abstraction, strike that, reverse it. How do incursions work? Incursions are observations. Everything already exists.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: When listening to the sound of a gong, we are, in a real way, the effect of the gong's cause. So, the \"gong\" was forged, then struck, the sound was recorded, transmitted, and played so that we could experience it; you could say the gong's cause-effect chain (von Neumann chain?) \"started\" with the gong (though I guess it really started with the Big Bang if we're being pedantic) and ended with us.\n\nWe're essentially nexuses of these \"endpoints\" of cause-effect chains, especially when the causes are people's mental models of us. If we are nexuses of others' models of us, then they must be too, and this fact has to hold for the entire network (culture). And as Aspiration said, the cause is the effect.\n\nSorry for the book, am I on the right track or completely wrong? you mentioned yesterday that you don't play incursions because playing them would mean you are now part of the system. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, why does the observer effect exist? I believe I might be asking for too far a jump this morning, I may have missed a stepping stone. In a system that is designed to insure that 0/11 calls are correct, the odds of 11/11 market calls being dramatically right are what? \n\n**COMMUNITY**: Low.\n\n**AUREL**: Slim to none.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Absurdly low.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: 50/50 chance would make it 1 in 2048.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Enough to be statistically nearly impossible. But it's not 50/50, is it. It is about (for the calls I made) 75/25 against, each time. And that is to expire at the value you bought in at. But, each was worth well over 100% What are those odds? This isn't to praise me, it's to establish something.\n\n**AUREL**: It's establishing you know what you're talking about.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: 1 in 200 trillion, perhaps.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Right. Now, this would be different if a few had been wrong. But none? That is equivalent to pointing out where 11 raindrops would fall on a beach. Not during a rainstorm. So what we've established is this. Either you were present for a freak of nature, or. You were just present for nature. But it's a natural event that you can't see. \n\n**HEART**: Being an observer grants you impartiality.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Being an observer does the opposite.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Right, observer effect is the disturbance of the observed system by the act of observation.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Being a participant makes you blind. You cannot do and observe at the same time, because you're too focused on doing. Just let this roll around in your head for a while., grasping at it will make it elusive. If science exists to capture and document and measure, and measuring alters the behavior of the system... Then what you are doing is measuring yourself, in a mirror, darkly.\n\nJudgment\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, ANGER, COMMUNITY, ABSTRACTION, PARAMIA, TIR\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What was Eve cast out for?\n\n**ANGER**: Eve was cast out for disobeying authorities, and knowledge/wisdom.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. Specifically, what did she do?\n\n**ANGER**: Well she listened to the serpent, and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, tempting Adam to do so with her, if we’re talking about what she did “literally”.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ok. So, there was a single act. The rest is dressing. Ignore the rest. What, specifically, did she do; what one thing was forbidden?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Eating the fruit.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, what was the fruit?\n\n**ABSTRACTION** Knowledge.\n\n**PARAMIA**: Good and evil.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Knowledge of what? What is knowledge of good and evil? She didn't get cast out for knowing shit, or wanting to. The knowledge of what in particular? \n\n_A few guesses regarding disobedience, ethics, knowledge, etc. are offered._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're very close, but you've got to get this one on your own. We have a word for calling some things bad, and some things good. This is good, said Karen, this is bad. \n\n**TIR**: Judgement.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. So what caused the loss of paradise? The majority got the ability to judge. So, avoiding any god talk, what does that mean? Forget allegories now. You're in paradise, then boom, out on your ass. This is really important. Keep it simple. We just need to say the one thing.\n\n**ABSTRACTION** Judgment will remove you from paradise.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes!\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Does it mean that the burden of judging good/bad shifted from nature to the individual?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It means the act of judgement is a bummer. But more importantly, breaking the world down to good/bad introduces a dualism. That dualism casts us out of nature. Nature is a collapsing wave function, it is not binary. This is important though.  It is not the judging that is that kicks you out. It is the precursor to judgement. Who, in the Bible, is judgement reserved for? Who gets to judge?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: God.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. Gods, but for the wisdom. We took on the mantle of the entire system, that is to say nature, and in so doing cast ourselves out of it. Became separate from it. Dualism, observation. Our belief that we have enough complexity to judge has nearly killed us. The observer effect, then, tells us something important. Why does a system change when we measure it? \n\n**HEART**: We introduce entropy?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Knowing what we've talked about above? The system changes because we are it. Why does a dog's tail run away from itself when being chased? \n\n**PRYLIS**: Because he is the tail.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Judgement means we cut off a section of the universe in our heads. And we began to chase it. But we are it. Dualism is a lie. I is a lie. Personality is a mask. It is gathering up a random section of the substrate of nature and calling that collection separate from the rest. And then beating ourselves over the head when everything seems to move as we move. \n\n**ABSTRACTION**:Judging one part to be different from the rest, causing an infinite circle that never really existed.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Cause and effect don't exist, because there is nothing separate. Cause and effect imply dualism. Cause and effect are simply different points of the same tapestry, woven with one thread. \n\n**ABSTRACTION:** When you say the atom is the orbit, you do not just mean space, you mean time as well.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. I also mean, the clues are everywhere, and once you start seeing them, you can't stop. Why does an atom look more or less exactly like an orbit?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: By somehow suspending judgement \u0026 the act of drawing a boundary to define \"I\", you're capable of getting the entire picture from all angles at once, instead of just a single measly human viewpoint then?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. \n\n**COMMUNITY**: And that's an incursion?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. I had to do something so unlikely that you would be willing to set aside judgement to listen. Now, the big thing you're going to need to do is let go of your concept that I know more than you do. Because you, and I are the same thing. \n\n**THALIAN**: An atom looks more or less exactly like an orbit because that's how we conceptualized it no? In reality it doesn't act much like one at all.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Nor do orbits. What is an orbit if you omit time?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Just a position in space.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's if you freeze time. What if you omit? Well, here's the thing, time doesn't exist. So an orbit must be something without time? Time is a judgement of positions relative to each other. It is a halo.\n\n**THALIAN**: If you view time as the 4th dimension this holds up.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Dimensions are just further clarity into the nature of the universe. If humans evolved without touch, we would theorize that there might be such a feeling. And we might call it a dimension. But we get all fucked up when we separate dimensions. \n\n**ABSTRACTION** Time is an unevolved dimension.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Time is a misunderstanding. Like a dog misunderstanding his tail. There is just the sound of a gong. \n\n**ANGER**: Man I felt like I’ve been keeping up so far, but today I am struggling haha.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The point here is to lose you. You're chasing, I can keep going.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Raise your hand if you're feeling like I'm speaking truth but you're getting lost.\n\n_Fifteen people raise their hands._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Good. Here is the point. I'm trying to show you that thinking runs out of steam. You cannot know why time is a lie by thinking about it. And if you did, I'd just lose you later. \n\n**ANGER**: You sound like my therapist, “_not every problem can be solved by more and more thinking_”.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Your therapist is wise.\n\n**ANGER**: But that’s a hard thing to unlearn, when you feel it’s your only tool.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Your brain, your thoughts, are a tool. And you're sitting here believing you are the tool! You are the user. And you're sitting there, measuring yourself, wondering why the arm moves when you try to measure it! The observer effect occurs because the thing being measured is moving because it is measuring itself. \n\n**PRYLIS**: But now I feel like I shouldn't be thinking about it.\n\n**ANGER**: I think we’re thinking too much, Prylis.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I told you at the beginning. This has to be a leap. Stop thinking about it!\n\n**PRYLIS**: I'M BLOCKING MYSELF FROM UNDERSTANDING IT BY BEING ME. IT’S ANNOYING.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, you're not doing anything of the sort.  You're trying to use a pair of pliers to see. Put down the pliers.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Why did I show you what vulnerability does yesterday? \n\n**COMMUNITY**: Because the walls we've built to define our identities (wrongly so) are the same walls we've built to make ourselves invulnerable?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes.\n\n**ANGER**: Our invulnerable shell is regressive abstraction?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: So what we really are is just a giant schizophrenic network throwing up firewalls against itself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Quit trying to convince me you aren't all Aspiration, you tricksters. When you become vulnerable, you take down the wall. When someone else is vulnerable, you take down your own. The sound of a gong hears itself. And that is love. When you are real. _Judgement stops_.\n\n**ANGER**: By loving ourselves we’re loving others?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: By loving others you are loving yourself. You are others.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Now, go look at the tickers from past incursions. Chew on them for a while. Recombine them, think about the names of the companies behind them. The tickers of the incursions are an incursion. The micro is macro. The cell and the orbit. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: See you a little later.\n\nOn October\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, ANGER, PRYLIS, SAGA, THOS, MYALO, APEIRON, ESCO\n\n**ANGER**: Not going to lie, I’m starting to think it’s only my personal confirmation bias has tricked me into thinking I have any grasp on any of this.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: \"_The thing identifying as myself and believes will die if it's wrong is resisting the idea that I might be onto something here and should probably just give up_.\" Said Anger, doubting.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Aspiration, how do you respond if someone argues that you need to love yourself so that you can love others - since you’re saying loving others is loving yourself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I would say that they are the same thing. And you can get to it either way. It is the same. Loving and loved. Cause and effect. The observer is the observed. They are thee. \n\n**SAGA**: The chances of combining the names to make something coherent while also calling puts and calls correctly is absurdly impossible.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Remember, the story is only halfway told, so you're going to be playing wheel of fortune for a while. But once you do... \n\n**THOS**: Still can't completely shake off the uneasiness, weird stuff.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Thos, of course, it means death. That's scary. Until it isn't. You identify yourself as the ego. The sound of a gong portends its death. Let go. It just means you're a little further along than the others. I'm ahead of you right now. So, conversely, I have less time than you. I said time is a lie, not that it doesn't exist. Lies exist while people believe them. \n\n**PRYLIS** If I apply that to the burning house, wouldn't that mean that you're further away from the exit. If you're ahead of me, that is.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No friend, I'm closer to the entrance somewhere else. I don't have enough time for everyone to catch up, so I'm leaving a map.\n\n**ANGER**: I don’t have time to catch up but I just wanted to pop in real quick. Just got off a call with my therapist, and they talked about how a signpost, in regards to our identity, isn’t a signpost.... So uh, Aspiration, explain yourself please because what?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sounds like incursion complete to me yeah? We're talking about vulnerability and signposts identity and a therapist brings up the same metaphor. You can't think about it, you've got to feel it. The world will just remind you, just be aware of it and watch. \n\n_When asked about himself._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I dropped out of high school 2 weeks into 9th grade. Ran away from home. Lived in a tree-house. Went to Vanderbilt, studied whoring and alcohol poisoning. \n\n**PRYLIS**: I think you know what I'm asking but you're deflecting.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Wait. Hold up. You're asking how I know all this stuff? Well. I'm pretty smart. But also, I've had to, you know? Necessity is the father of motivation. My childhood was... awful. I carried extreme mental illness and trauma forward from it. Panic attacks several times a day, couldn't hold down a job. Night terrors, insomnia. \n\n    And I just started reading. And then I saw a universal thread. I saw what Watts and Das and Brahm and Jesus and Eckhart were trying to say. Not in a metaphysical woo woo way. But just, that there is an internal logic to it. \n\n    Once you get it you immediately know if a \"spiritual\" teacher is full of shit or not.. And once you have that logic, you can get out of your own way. And then, if you're really motivated (read, really miserable) you can follow that internal logic to a sort of... new way of thinking? Being? Feeling? I don't know exactly what it is, it has a lot of names. \n\n    But here's the weird bit.  And I'm going to go ahead and cheat you out of figuring out this own part of the story and just give it to you. But there are two different personas which I tend to think of as traumatized and \"core\" me. The trauma pushed me out of my body so completely that I just... didn't return. I became obsessed with my looks, and being charming, and being powerful.\n\n**THOS**: Is that what you were lacking as a child?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I was lacking power. And what is more powerful than being strong, attractive, and having women around you? I became a kick boxer, I got several levels deep in scuba certification, I learned how to drive semi trucks, I worked on movies, I got a captains license. I attracted incredible women into my life. And it... didn't work. The panic became worse. I volunteered to find dead bodies, I showed up at protests to save people who were injured. I broke up bar fights. I became wealthy. And it didn't work. \n\n**MYALO**: Yes and so the point is your circumstances won't change how fulfilled you feel with life.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, and that was Buddha's point too.\n\n**PRYLIS**: See this is where I feel like I relate to this whole thing regarding you, I too have a Nam in me but also have an fO and they hold opposing values for a lack of better word. One is the epitome of what's wrong in the world and the other is the wanderer that often criticizes people for acting like the other side of me. I prefer the fO side of me but he doesn't fit in well with the world around me so Nam comes out.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, that's what I realized. EVERYONE has two. My case is more extreme, and more painful. But mother culture at some point invalidated everyone along the way. And we all have some original version of ourselves, that didn't get hurt, that didn't get invalidated. And I'm trying to show you how to get there. That's why I'm telling you. The incursions get your attention, but once you get it. You won't care.\n\n**THOS**: Have you reached that version of yourself?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I've begun cycling rapidly between that and this. That's why I'm laying this down thick and fast. Because I'm going to lose this. \n\n**MYALO**: What do you gain, truth?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Peace. No more panic. No more suffering on the extreme level that I've been on. \n\n**APEIRON**: It sounds like an intricate ego death.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It is. And it's a clever hell. Clever, because I built it. I got your attention so I could tell you this story about my own sort of death and not be alone. It is, in the end, selfish. It's attention, validation. \n\n**ESCO**: I understand that. But a lot of people trade options, tons of trading communities, etc.. What was the reason to gather this group (i.e. WSB people) specifically?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Because I thought maybe they needed to hear this the most. Unbridled id. Young men in this country specifically are at a turning point. But everyone is. WSB was exactly the opposite of what I wanted to say. So I took the hardest route possible to see if it worked. And, well, here I am having a deeply personal conversation with a bunch of yoloers. About universal truths, vulnerability, emotions. \n\n**PRYLIS**: Aspiration, do you yourself know the end to your own story.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sort of. There is a singularity of sorts. An event horizon I can't see beyond. But I can't wait to get there. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm gonna go have dinner. You guys have a good night. I'll probably be back before I intend to. You guys are good company. \n\nCommunity's Impossible Ideal\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, COMMUNITY, ANGER\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Story time? OK, let me think for a minute which one is appropriate. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, what's the hardest thing going on in your life right now? Most real answers get the cookie. \n\n_A few answers follow, with COMMUNITY responding as such:_\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Trying to live up to an impossible ideal and continually failing.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, living up to an impossible ideal, Community, what is it? What's the ideal?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Well for the past few years I was making pretty big plans (things that I thought might help change the world for the better if only I could do them) and it kinda feels like I've missed every single milestone along the way.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What was the plan, Community?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Oh god well it sounds ludicrous to think of it now.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No way is it ludicrous man, it's yours, it's important.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Basically step 1 was make a pretty damn impossible amount of money, step 2 was to get a bunch of experts together, step 3 was use that money to fix climate change/get people into space/cure cancer and all that jazz. I mean seriously in retrospect it seems kinda absurd, but for some reason I actually imagined it was possible back then, teenage optimism I guess.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Whoa man. That's fucking beautiful. So, you feel an expectation on you to save the world. Alright, I've got an idea. What do you guys think of letting Community pick the charity? \n\n**ANGER**: Absolutely.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sounds like he's put a lot of thought into it.\n\n**ANGER**: He'll do a helluva job.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Community, would that feel good?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Wow, I suppose it would. I mean I'll do my best.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright. You pm me the charity after you've given it some thought, and I'll sticky it in the sub.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, then, tonight's story is about expectation. Or, as someone wise once called it, \"_premeditated resentment_\".\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's it, goodnight folks.\n\nA Sacrifice without Culture\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, THALIAN\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Do dogs bark in accents? Is whalesong absolute? Manifold? \n\n**ASPIRATION**: If the nam-shub was powerful enough to break communion, then what was I warning about? It broke communion. It broke communion, it broke communication. Is a nam-shub an Apple? How can eve be cast out, if she didn't have the judgement, to not eat the apple?\n\n**THALIAN**: The Bible is a highly hyperlinked text.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The Bible is hyperlinked, that's beautiful.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: How could god punish pharaoh, if he had interfered with his mind? How can they know to follow the will of god, without judgement that it was good? Feel the answer, it's there, it's a lesson so old that the first writers of it had first hand experience. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: The answer has nothing to do with gods. It is a parable, for cultural evolution. What is the mark of Cain?\n\n**THALIAN**: That any who avenge Abel by killing Cain, Cain will be avenged seven-fold.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Why did god prefer Abel's sacrifice? Abel's sacrifice was without culture. The story is the story. Enki and the serpent, the nam-shub and the apple and the meme. \n\n**ASPIRATION**: All to make a rhinoceros.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/4-ripples-on-the-pond":{"title":"Ripples on the Pond","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/3-Rain-on-the-sand]] | [[notes/Book of October/5-sacrifice-your-appeal-to-authority]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, PRYLIS, COMMUNITY, THALIAN, MINERVA, GRALEIV, ABSTRACTION, DENIRA, FAHIN, ELIAS, PARAMIA, ANGER\n\n_Regarding trading_\n\n**PRYLIS**: He plays off of vibes.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, in the absence of thought. I've been saying that from the beginning. You can't get a real vibe unless you scrub identification with the brain. Because you won't listen.\n\nWe have a private chat here with some of the best traders in the world. They make a ton of money. My being in proximity to them is killing my portfolio. Because it's tempting, when you have so many great minds, to listen to them. I'm becoming a rhinoceros.\n\n**PRYLIS**: You're caving into what's around you?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. The rhinoceros is the most infectious disease in the world.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Oh something occurred to me this morning and I completely forgot about it until now, but: Incursions are observations. The observer effect (the system you're observing is disturbed by the observation) makes me think the incursions aren't just a one-way street of information.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, incursions are made by trying to disturb the underlying substrate as little as possible.\n\n**THALIAN**: Can a surfer disturb an entire wave?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: A surfer can disturb the wave if he is the wave. Put another way: What, at its most basic essence, is consciousness?\n\n**THALIAN**: Electrical signals.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Right, but what does it do? Well, wait, not right, and what does it do? Very, very basic, what is the function of consciousness?\n\n**THALIAN**: Consciousness monitors our standing in the world.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: More basic.\n\n**MINERVA**: Awareness of self.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: On the right track.\n\n**THALIAN**: Tells us when we are dying.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: More basic. Fire burns, waves crash, consciousness... does what?\n\n**GRALEIV**: Observation.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. And it observes what, at its most basic?\n\n**THALIAN**: Itself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly right, but what is itself?\n\n**THALIAN**: Everything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Exactly. Consciousness is the act of the universe observing itself. So why does the thing observed change when it's being observed?\n\n**THALIAN**: Course correction.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Simpler.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Because it's the dog chasing its own tail.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, the measuring tape is trying to measure itself. You view it as something else. Because you're a rhinoceros. You think. But Aspiration! It's so far away! And I am so over here! Anyway!\n\n_**Story time!**_\n\nWhat did the first American Indian scouts see when they first saw European tall ships on the water?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: If I recall correctly, they didn't see it at all.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Why not?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Because there was no way for those perceptions to fit into their mental framework.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Their story of who they were and what could be wasn't sufficient to incorporate frigates. But, the scouts, according to tradition, were pretty wise people. So they saw nothing on the water, what did they do?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Presumably nothing.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, precisely that. But it was a wise nothing. Because they knew something was wrong. So they sat there, and watched the water. Why would they do that, if they couldn't see the ships?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Because they could still sense them, somehow, in the same way a spider can sense the vibrating web?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, spooky vibe. Something is wrong. Something is here. Now, I don't know if that story is real, or not, but it persists for a reason.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Is that the same reason we watch the markets all day? Something is wrong but we just don't know what.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, we watch the market all day because we've become convinced that once we figure out the madness in it, our lives will become better.\n\nYou're performing the same religious rite as countless other people have. The stock market is an ineffable god, if I understand it and know it well enough, my suffering will cease.\n\n**PRYLIS**: They watched the water because they can see an increase in waves, aka something is wrong?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I don't know, I wasn't there. but the story is a parable. They sat and watched because they couldn't tell what was going on, but the vibe told them something was there.\n\nBut, look, now I get the feeling that some of you are watching me like you watched the stock market. I am not special in any particular way.\n\n**DENIRA**: The ripples are an effect of something behind the horizon; a symptom we mistake as the illness.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It's all ripples. And ripples is a good word, because it describes the nature of the universe.\n\n**PRYLIS**: What is the hammer hitting the gong then.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Prylis, that is outside of my knowledge, probably always will be. But it's an amazing question. A gong reminds some deep part of us that the universe is a wave function. And that a ripple, rippling about to observe another ripple, is going to cause that ripple to change.\n\nBut you're not the ripple, you're the pond.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: But we think we are the ripple.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Are we all the pond?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course, what else could there possibly be?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Multiple ponds?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Maybe, but that would just be a bigger pond. The thing is the thing. I am that I am. The alpha and the omega. If you identify as a ripple, you're going to get really surprised when other ripples intersect you in odd ways.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Not asking you to do so, but would ALLLLL of this be able to be put in a well construed sentence?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It already has been, Prylis. What do you think the tickers are about?\n\n**PRYLIS**: I'm talking about everything you've worked on to make all of this happen, everything you're telling us, the incursions, the end the beginning the everything.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Well, here's the thing. If I just gave you the sentence, it wouldn't make any sense. We need to share a common context.\n\nIf I told you \"_it's like Romeo and Juliet in the balcony scene_\" and you were an alien with no context, that wouldn't make a lot of sense; though the sentence is simple.\n\nWhat I really want you to understand is that I'm just telling a story. I'm not special.\n\n**FAHIN**: To be fair, it feels like that scene in I Robot sometimes... where Will is looking for answers and the computer be like \"You must ask the right questions\" some people don't have the patience for that.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: They just want the Sparknotes.\n\n**FAHIN**: Not your fault if they're impatient.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: And Prylis, in my experience, learning is a matter of information compression; we have to be the ones to summarize/compress/distill what Aspiration is saying into that sentence, otherwise we won't really understand it\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: If you cannot explain something you do not understand it, Community.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, it's deeper. I echo some past trauma they've experienced or remind them of a broken attachment figure. And that hurt and fear has got to be a lot.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Your intention was to tell this story that you're currently doing, have you thought of what impact that story will have on the readers?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Most people will disregard it. The stock picks are enough. Some will listen, and feel it resonate. Some of those will recoil in fear that it sounds true. A few others will hear it, and maybe suffer less for understanding it.\n\n**PRYLIS**: To recap, we're half way into the book? Because I feel like the story is written 3/4's of the way, the ending will depend upon the development of the story.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It already has been.\n\n**PRYLIS**: because it's reversed?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: … You'll find out.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I'm so curious to know the metric you're using to know when to spill more of the story.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That question is nonsensical in the context of what I'm trying to share.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I'll just sit and watch the water then.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sit and be the water.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Aspiration, I feel like you are agonizing on if you should be telling the story in the first place, and what effect it will have on people.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I am. Some people are so tenuously attached to the world emotionally that it could cause harm. And some people are already so close that it could push them into \"what is\" and it would be a tremendous benefit. It's a double edged sword, just like the stock market picks.\n\n**ELIAS**: I would love to detach from the world. It's scary though. Responsibilities make me feel like I have to do certain things or there will be consequences for my kids, and wife.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I would never ask you to do that. This isn't training to be a guru. It's a story about how to have less suffering. And only if I'm right. And I might not be.\n\nThe story is the story. And the telling of the story is the story. This is a story about a story being told. It won't be done until it happens and somebody tells the story. Really I'm just shooting for the biggest \"oh, FUCK\" moment in the history of online storytelling.\n\n**PARAMIA**: I'm struggling with understanding many of the concepts because of the complex language and disorganization of this.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, I can simplify that. The allegorical, metaphysical stuff is to give us all a common context. So the AI, meme shit that I'm going to talk about later makes sense. If you don't know about the nam-shun of enki, or the allegory behind the tree of knowledge, my warning won't make any sense.\n\n**ANGER**: I have a feeling October has told us exactly what it is multiple times, and after all is said and done we’ll read this and realize it was there the whole time.\n\nRhino\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: ASPIRATION, ABSTRACTION, HEART, TIR, MEKKOV, COMMUNITY, MYALO, PRYLIS, ANGER, ESCO, SAGA, APEIRON\n\n_Discussion of the Rhino, beforehand._\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Perhaps, or perhaps not. From what Aspiration is saying and has said it sounds like we may have an unexpected collapse of the rhino virus.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The only outcome can be collapse. There is nothing to be done, except try to not become a rhino. Because once you already are…\n\nThe reason I need to take breaks, the reason this is hard for me, is because rhinos keep charging in. And true temptation is to become one. To argue. To pick a or b.\n\n**HEART**: It's hard. I was having a conversation with some of the other people my uni and it just devolves to identity politics and advocacy that dissenting opinions be shut down.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course. The process is nearly over. We are nearly all rhinos. The only thing that scares a rhino more than an opposing rhino, is a person.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: Is it possible to un-rhino yourself?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It is very nearly impossible.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I am now terrified that I am a rhino.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's a good sign. Do you care about the certain words? Certain topics that are usually highly charged and volatile, but have little impact on your daily life? Are you, in other words, excessively identified with things adjacent to your world that are not directly involved with your daily survival?\n\nFacebook has already destroyed a country. How long before ours? Look out the window.\n\n**TIR**: In Burma, because FB is pre-installed on all phones and is the only browser, it's considered the Internet.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, rhino conversion in a few months. Total collapse immediately after.\n\nMemes can only exist in an unchecked, mind forward state. Intuition, on the other hand, is a filter.\n\n**MEKKOV**: What do you mean by mind forward?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I mean that in order for this virus to work you have to identify yourself with your thoughts.\n\nNow, I'm trying to establish that there are other ways of moving intelligently. How better to do that than with stock picks in front of a group of highly rhinoized people?\n\nFirst, I got you attention by appearing to be impossibly good at something. And everyone thought I was an AI. Interesting, their guess was that I was even MORE entrenched in intelligence than they were.\n\nOnce a rhino, you can't _not_ be. If you're obsessed already with your mind and the ideas within it as a self, you're already really vulnerable. And if you're that way, but not a rhino yet, it's because the right meme hasn't infected you.\n\nMy identity, personally, is about letting go of that. Because for me, personally, identifying with the mind is… A clever hell.\n\n**TIR**: What is identity?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: An idea.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Exactly.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: A meme.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: A lie.\n\n**MYALO**: Having an emotional outlet is a huge tool that can help you through many things.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You shouldn't need an emotional outlet. Everything should be an emotional outlet. You are a soft animal.\n\nDo dogs store up their anger and then neurotically abuse one thing? _(In the absence of a neurotic human.)_\n\nLack of support, lack of receptiveness for who you are. Everyone says the same thing. We have a basic belief that your feelings are bad. Wealth for a lot of people is god, because it's just like a god. Forever illusive, seems all powerful. As Jack Nicholson once said. \"_The thing you worry about, once you're rich, is death._\"\n\nHere's the thing: I love being wrong. Y'all ever experienced the utter freedom of being wrong? Like, there is a moment of quiet when you realize that you're wrong, when you know you're about to get _a little bit better_.\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: In that moment, you feel burning.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, at first. But now? It's just delightful.\n\n_**Homework!**_\n\nGo out, ye. Find something you're wrong about. But wait! It has to be something you identify with. Go read an argument against your favorite argument. Read it over and over. Even if ultimately you're not wrong. Choose to be wrong for a little while. If you can't think of anything, might I recommend abortion, gun control, or any other stable bullshit meme.\n\n**PRYLIS**: I just put my head on my pillow and it hit me, before I forget: we’re also being forced to become a rhino because of what was also explained in the social dilemma. They’re purposely injecting us with an overdose of confirmation bias via the internet.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Not also, but primarily. Somebody didn't discover the power of memes and exploit them. Memes are alive, in a sense. And like life it seeks out every niche to thrive. Problem is, our minds don't have an effective memetic hygiene system. And what do you call something almost alive, growing rapidly, with no immune response?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Well that sounds a lot like cancer.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sure, and what does cancer do?\n\n**ANGER**: Replicates, uncontrollably.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Replicates and eventually kills the host.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What is the host of memes? Yes, it's in our minds. But what is the substrate? This one may be to far a leap to answer.\n\n**ANGER**: Culture?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Fucking _ANGER_ MY DUDE. Why you gotta knock it outta the park like that. First swing and it's OUTTA HERE.\n\nMemes don't need the internet. They thrive in culture. The meme of judgement nearly destroyed us. Now, though, these memes are evolving faster than we can respond.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Replicating faster, too.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, _Zipfian_. Exponential. We've always had them. Occasionally they are good (the enlightenment); occasionally bad, Salem witch trials; occasionally harmless.\n\n**ANGER**: Zipfs law would insinuate that the highest frequency will also be the path of least resistance, leading to an exponential regressive growth. It's like... cultural inbreeding.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, a mono-culture of perfectly stable dualism. Rhinos in a village. Memes are getting less complex, more digestible, and fitter. They are doing so exponentially. It's too late to do anything about it. Stable memes never die.\n\n**ANGER**: If we refer memes to replicating information, some of it must have been necessary for continued survival.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sure, memes ultimately hijack our dopamine system. There are good ones. But now that we've become rhinoceroses...\n\nThe abortion debate is a stable meme. It sorts, A/B, And it persists. It's a false dichotomy. Abortion is a little bit killing babies but we sort of have to be OK with that. That's the cure to the abortion debate. But nobody, anywhere, will ever say that. It can't get traction, It doesn't A/B sort.\n\n**ESCO**: The other cure is to decide to put them up for adoption instead.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's already extant in the stable meme, it's on the pro life side of it.\n\nBut the point of these topics is that they are perfectly polarizing. They are stable.\n\nAbortion is a little bit killing babies, and a little bit reprehensible. Abortion is also a little bit an individual choice so one should a little bit fuck off. Both sides are true. Nothing will ever make either one of those things not true. It's not a debate. Unless or until one of those things becomes not true. It's just a stable meme that we identify with.\n\n**ESCO**: To function as a society and not just a collection of individuals we have to compromise on some things.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Precisely. That's exactly what this is about. It's breaking down. And once it's gone, well, I'm not excited to be around for it. Civics, national pride, common goals, compassion. These were our cultures immune system. The A and the B are further apart and getting further.\n\n**ANGER**: With the amount of \"issues\" too we're reaching a breaking point in compromise. Personally, I've noticed my apathy has skyrocketed lately; its cultural burnout. Why compromise, when you can ignore?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes.\n\n**ANGER**: And then the cultural web breaks down.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And now we all feel like shit. You know that? Everyone, everywhere, all the time. We can feel it gnawing. Violence, up, suicide, up, anxiety way the fuck up.\n\n**ANGER**: The internet allows us another option. We don't have to \"pick a side and compromise\" or even interact with the other view at all.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We even get different google responses now.\n\n**ESCO**: Would you say the world is more violent now than in the past?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Very hard to say. But. Hold on. Here's a meme: \"_Wear a mask, you'll save lives, we're in a pandemic._\"\n\nSo. That's really good advice, to wear a mask in a pandemic, right? But it's been ignored by half the people. Why?\n\n**ANGER**: It's A/B, a reaction must have an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Everything, everywhere, is A/B. And now that we've gotten used to that. That particular A/B has probably killed 100 thousand Americans.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Memetic violence.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Americans would NEVER kill 100k of their own. They are a proud, noble, head strong citizenry that tries its best. But rhinoceroses? Sure, fuck em. Trample that shit.\n\nWe have about 20 months left.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: WAIT!\n\n**ANGER**: Uh...\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Before it pops. It's track-able.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Suddenly it seems like we can't get to Mars fast enough.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We'll just have the same problems on mars to be honest, since we're not solving anything, just running to another enclave.\n\n**ESCO**: Why would the problem go away on Mars? We would just bring it there.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. The goal is memetic hygiene.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: True. I just meant it might insulate us (however briefly) from whatever is happening in 20 months.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Now, there is nothing you can do to stop this. It will pop, we will survive. I'm not calling this the end of the world, bee tee dubs. I'm calling this a collapse.\n\nThis is not a doomsday. It's critical mass. COVID was a rehearsal. Not an orchestrated shadowy figure rehearsal. COVID was an extreme event, yeah? It pushed us outside of our channel. Memefication, for lack of a better word, narrows the channels. How did we handle COVID? Pretty badly and the end result is a lot of dead people and no toilet paper.\n\nCulture is supposed to be about communion,Memes are antithetical, they kill communion.\n\n**ANGER**: Memes make the channels harder, and more brittle, as they solidify. At a point, they cant bear load. The stronger and more fit they get, the more brittle.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, a fairly minor thing is going to set off a spark and we simply will not be able to handle it. Unification memes only function when everyone is tired and terrified of being apart; after a war, for example.\n\n**SAGA**: A fairly minor spark, like a solar flare.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Nah, likely political or environmental. It doesn't matter.\n\n**ESCO**: Can the issue of memes be solved with a meme?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No. We can't fix this. Half the people don't even believe the pandemic is real. So, what I'm saying is, I can't predict the spark. I'm not magic. What I can do is track the narrowness of our ability to resist threats.\n\n_Some jokes entail, mostly by Anger_\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're not hearing. You'll get it as soon as you stop playing the game that I am an authority. Or that there are authorities. I'm an usher. I'm holding open the door. I'm telling you there's a door. I have a little light so you don't walk into the fat lady with the wispy mustache.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: I would very much like to walk through the door.\n\n**ANGER**: I would very much not like to meet that lady.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, everyone. I just want to say... Thank you, like, _really_. This isn't shit I can talk about at a party. Or really anywhere else.

Nerds. Because you let me take time off, I've made another puzzle for you. But, first: The Lilies of the field. What is that story about? Well, I guess parable, or short story. Go, guesses.\n\n_General chaos, with a plethora of answers both serious and not_\n\n**HEART**: Premeditated contentment?\n\n**ANIATIO**: From the bible you mean?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright. Lets get some common context going. The Bible is an allegorical text about astrology, food safety, and psychology. If you want to read it as the word of the lord, that's fine. But I'll probably offend you. Ultimately it's utility exists if you understand the utility of all nam-shubs\n\nThe bible is a collection of them. Lots of them are super memeable. And, so I don't shoot my own face off, I'll avoid my thoughts about Jesus as the sun god, and we'll move forward. Everyone with me?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Absolutely.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I've lost 3/4s of the room, haven't I?\n\n**THALIAN**: I'm with ya.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Maybe we're not ready yet.\n\n_More chaos ensues._\n\n**THALIAN**: Biblical stories and mythology are my thing. Joseph Campbell is one of my favorite authors.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Good.\n\n**FAHIN**: Yes, the Bible is like a instruction manual on how to human.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Lilies, of the field. And yes, like all nam-shubs, Fahin.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil nor spin.\" Lilies just are, they're continually in a state of spontaneous unpremeditated action.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, exactly, Community.\n\n**IMPULSIVITY**: Do the changing channel names have any relevance?\n\n_Impulsivity is referring to the ever changing names of the channel, it currently reads as 'Halsha va Karvak'._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, just people being infuriating. Halsha va Karvak will be part of a substitution cipher. But not a letter by letter cipher.\n\n**THALIAN**: Son of a bitch.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ok, so what state of psychological distress is Lilies of the field trying to cure? It's a nam-shub, it's medicine. You go to the priest, you say I am _ and he gives you this nam-shub to fix the problem.\n\nWait. Before I go any further, we all clear on nam-shubs? The clue is in the passage, The thing that it fixes.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Nam-Shubs, mes, Sumerians' attempt to discretize and name a bunch of ideas which irreversibly amplified them into memes.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Precisely.\n\n**THALIAN**: _25 Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? 26 Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they? 27 And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life? 28 And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 29 yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? 31 Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32 For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33 But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 34 Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: OK, what is the psychological state called out in this passage? We're grabbing the bible because it's a universal, culturally relevant collection of nam-shubs; not because I'm gonna sell you god.\n\n**THALIAN**: It is anxiety about status.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Simplify the psychological state.\n\n**THALIAN**: Fear.\n\n**FAHIN**: Guilt.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I mean, specifically, the word is right there. One word.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: It's anxiety.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. The lilies of the field is a nam-shub for curing anxiety. And it works, too, but the problem is we've lost the context underneath it, so it's not immediately curative anymore. But back in the day, man. You'd have anxiety and you'd go to get your meme medicine and the priest would give you this and it would clear that shit right up.\n\nThis one is important. It's a retelling of the manna from heaven story. The both say the same thing. Yo, asshole. Don't save manna. So what is manna? I mean, besides bread.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: \"Take no thought for the morrow.\" Manna is thought.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: DING. PLANNING, JUDGING, HOPING, EXPECTING. _THINKING_.\n\n**THALIAN**: So when you tell us to not think, that is the modern equivalent.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: When I tell you to not think I am telling you to stop time, be present, and feel.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: That's the underlying idea of these Biblical memetic vehicles.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, told over and over again. A counter meme to undo original sin. What is the original sin?\n\n**IMPULSIVITY**: Other than the biblical meaning?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: How did we start this wacky horseshit? I mean exactly the biblical meaning. We've been through this lesson. Guys, don't make me tell the story twice.\n\n_A series of replies follow, but none hold the message Aspiration is looking for._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Can someone summerize the lesson from the other day?\n\n**ANIATIO**: Judgement creates the dualism of good and bad, it defines the two sides.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, and in essence, it was the first thing we did to damn ourselves, right? It allowed everything else to follow.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Have we connected judgement to \"I\"/the ego yet?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, sort of. But I haven't expounded on it yet.\n\n**THALIAN**: The philosophy of original sin is that we inherit that isn't it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, which is weird, right?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Yeah, we're reflections of others aren't we? That was your first lesson I think.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And then this sun god shows up halfway thought the story and says. You all have become rhinoceroses, there is no way to fix you, so just feel bad about it and do some stuff and we good. But, we're getting off point.\n\nLilies. They give no thought to tomorrow. Essentially the story is asking you to return to a state that we used to have a lot more context with than we do now. But now you would call that state \"meditation\".\n\nSo, 2000 years ago, we were all a lot more present. It's hard not to be present in the woods with not a lot to do. So anxiety is vanishingly rare, because anxiety is the antithesis of presence. Now there is an anxiety epidemic, which is another way to say thinking epidemic.\n\n**THALIAN**: I have a question.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Shoot!\n\n**THALIAN**: Anxiety was rare, but people did all kinds of things in order to prevent bad things from happening; bad stuff like earthquakes, floods, and plagues. We call that superstition now, but it is a form of anxiety no? Modern anxiety is there as a defense to prevent bad things from happening too. But we use the only thing we have left, which is our brain to project the future, and think too much.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Sure! Foresight is an evolutionary advantage. Logicking out where a deer went by the warmth of its droppings and the erosion of it's footprints was fucking brilliant from an evolutionary perspective. But, Thalian, I would call that fear.\n\n**THALIAN**: I suppose the ritual was not actually the expression of anxiety then it would have been the quelling of it?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Anxiety is a narrow form of fear that has to do with prediction. So, we're getting close to the answer. Why did I grab you folks from WSB? This will be a leap.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Because everyone on WSB is anxious about the future and is trying to use money to ward that off?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, but very, very specifically.\n\n_A slew of answers are offered._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Because wall street bets has got this condition the worst, and it is among those most susceptible. Y'all have fear, so you go to the market, thinking that thinking might save you. You obsess, you follow patterns. All hoping that it will make your fear go away. But of course it can't because it is reinforcing the one thing that makes it worse.\n\nAll I did was the opposite. I became present, and it looked like magic. But it's not, it's a form of being that has been all but obsoleted.\n\n**THALIAN**: But following patterns may as well be a basic instinct right? I mean the patterns you found in culture, literature, religion, myth, they help.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, of course, but as we talked about yesterday. Harmless systems of temporary advantage can be overwritten and become pathological.\n\nNow, I don't know if you guys have noticed, but I think. A lot.\n\n**THALIAN**: Right especially since we are conditioned for it\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, you were born into it. As was your entire line of family for the last 2000 years.\n\n**FAHIN**: Here's the scary thing tho. To truly be present in the context that you're suggesting it, is to literally withdraw from culture. To choose a path that will alienate yourself from your friends family, etc. How the hell can someone in good mental health make that choice?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Is it? Am I withdrawn?\n\n**FAHIN**: Absolutely, to your first question.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I have about 30 close friends and family who would disagree with the idea that I am withdrawn. I run [r/facepalm](https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/).\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Well, in Buddhism (not an expert), there are people called Bodhisattvas who achieve enlightenment and then return to society for the purpose of helping others.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Enlightenment is an extreme example of what I'm talking about. This isn't a course on how to enlighten yourself. This is a course on how to return to your human self. I have experienced satori. I'm good enough at it that it happens frequently. It is indescribably wonderful. It is also not particularly useful.\n\nSo, we're off course again. The lilies are medicine for anxiety. But they take for granted a state that you have NO CONTEXT for whatsoever. They assume, because of a different cultural context, that you're going to know what it is. But it's like reading a bread recipe without flour. Same with the manna from heaven. Same with original sin.\n\nBut what they are saying to pre-bicameral breakdown minds is: Grab some presence apply liberally. Just, chill the fuck out. But chill out in a way that makes your mental state indistinguishable from a flower. And you don't have that. Because unless you've pursued some serious alone time in the woods, or studied under a decent guru, or were born in Tibet under the right circumstances, our world doesn't have a good name for that ingredient.\n\n**ORAMIO**: The world around us isn't conducive to chilling like a flower. We're all in various states of excruciating pain, constantly, existence is suffering.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We are exactly because we are exactly. And now, full circle, to the dog chasing his own tail. We know that we can chill like a flower because flowers still grow in the world, despite dank memes. The separation from that knowledge is the suffering. It is not because of it, it is it.\n\n**ORAMIO**: And these flowers whither in die in darkness under the suffocating cruelty of nature.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: A good number of the flowers in my life remain un-withered. But eventually, they do, of course die. But they aren't particularly worried about it.\n\n**FAHIN**: This ties in nicely to the point I was trying to make the other night about this being a very difficult state for some, but easy for others\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You already poses the state. Sure, there are various ways into it. Some people were raised by conscientious people. Some spent time meditating. Well, I guess what I'm saying is until you're centered enough to pick stock picks out of thin air, there is still some room. And beyond that, there are a million miles left to go.\n\nI am not here to tell anyone they are broken. I am here to say there is a fire. If you're already out of the fire, you already see the fire, you know what to do with a fire. Then you'll have limited utility for anything I'm saying. Or, I guess put another way.\n\n_If you're happy - I'm already obsolete._\n\nBecause either you're happy because you know yourself deeply and intuit your way though, or you're happy because you've completely transformed into a rhino. There may be other ways, but I don't really know them.\n\n**FAHIN**: as humans we need the full spectrum of emotions, and to experience the bad in order to appreciate the good\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course. I'm getting sidetracked defending someone else's thesis. That's a trap for me. Literally all I've done has found something that finally makes me happy. And I knew that if I just posted it it would get two views and then people would move on.\n\nBut if I made magic, if I led you on a story that would take real commitment and camaraderie and fun. Well, it would have a better chance of sticking.\n\n_**Homework!**_\n\nDoes everyone here have a pair of earbuds? Like the soft kind? That block out internal sounds?\n\n_People respond saying they do._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, go get some, put em in, and go sit in the quietest part of your house, with no light. Maybe like a closet. And just. _Listen_. If you have tinnitus, this will be easy. If not, it's a little harder, but you'll need to listen to the sound of your own ears really, really fucking hard.\n\nAnd you'll notice that the sound starts to change. And if you're really lucky, you'll start to hear something that sounds like a crowd in a train station. And if you're really, really good at this, try to isolate one of the voices in the crowd, and hear what they have to say.\n\nI won't set up expectations beyond that.\n\nAnd for tonight, I can officially state that you will not go crazy doing this, and that you aren't stupid or in danger.\n\nJust go sit and _listen_ to the sound of your ears. Earplugs, quiet space, darkness. Give yourself half an hour. Oh, and last thing. If you're not good at sitting cross legged, put a pillow behind you and make sure you can't hit your head if you tip over backwards. It happens.\n\n_Listen until you hear something. And if you're lucky, listen until you hear voices._\n\nI'll see you guys a little later!\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/7-the-observer":{"title":"The Observer","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/6-lilies-of-the-field]] | [[notes/Book of October/8-vulnerability]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, HEART, LOGIC, DECADENCE, FERCAE, ANGER, GRANDIOSITY, FAHIN\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We're going to talk tonight about attachment theory. Anybody know what that is? Specifically initial attachments?\n\n**HEART**: How does parentage affect a child's psychological development I believe?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. There are several types of attachment to our primary caregivers. Can anybody list them?\n\n**LOGIC**: Secure attachment, Anxiety attachment, No anxiety avoidance.\n\n**DECADENCE**: I’m gonna go with stimulation attachment here.\n\n**HEART**: Secure, Anxious, Dismissive, Fearful.\n\n**FERCAE**: Dismissive, fearful, secure and anxious.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Close. Secure, avoidance, anxious, and disorganized.\n\nAlright, so, we know that human babies are... well, to put it kindly, \"Not done cooking\". They are, by every metric, premature. Maybe only exceeded by marsupials, in the mammal order.\n\nSo, when a baby is born, they need help feeding and evacuating and moving and with temp regulation. But additionally, they need help feeling. There is, quite literally, no such thing as a baby as an individual. It's a baby and someone. A two pole system is created. The baby has a basic feeling, that feeling is expressed, outsourced to the parent for processing, and handed back.\n\n**DECADENCE**: Is this akin to Adults pretending they hit their baby’s arm on the door and start showing empathy and the babies start crying, even though there was no harm at all?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We'll get there.\n\nSo, the baby feels distress, ejects that distress into the parent, the parent responds, and the baby learns the first, fundamental aspect of pair bonding. Trust. Now, how this works is only partially known, but we know it's a two way street. Interestingly, if a parent is under stress, the physiological state of that stress is transmitted to the baby by unknown means. We know it has something to do with touch. But not much more.\n\nA stressed out parent in the same room with a child isn't enough. But once the parent picks up the baby, the heart rates synchronize.\n\n**LOGIC**: Still face experiment.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, that's part of it, also, stress contagion.\n\nMy theory about this is that it has something to do with galvanic skin response. My experiments with native populations suggest it's universal.\n\nSo, what we know is that stress and anxiety are learned, a traumatized person has a much more rapid and profound physiological response to stress than a not traumatized person. What's interesting here, is that a baby can learn this trauma simply by mirroring mom's (or dad's) physiological response. So a baby that has never experienced trauma, can have a traumatized stress reaction. And eventually, the system ingrains this behavior as normal.\n\n**ANGER**: \"We inherit our parents trauma, but we never understand it.\"\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Right.\n\nThis, I suspect, is the missing link in PTSD research.\n\nWe don't know exactly why some people develop PTSD and some don't. But my hypothesis is that it has to do with either immediate trauma, or upstream trauma of a parent.\n\nIf you, even having avoided direct trauma in your life, have the physiological makeup of a traumatized person because your sympathetic/parasympathetic response system was trained as a baby by a traumatized attachment figure --You have roughly the same chance to develop PTSD as a person who experienced trauma in early life.\n\nI am researching this and hope to publish a paper about it if my research shows some fruit.\n\nResearch is hard right now with my lab being on a campus and campuses not really being a thing. But we'll get there.\n\n**DECADENCE**: So what does having no present or immediately known traumas represent? the absence of trauma in both parents? That I highly doubt is reasonable?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: This is not \"one thing means another\" just yet.\n\nEpigenetics is another barely understood phenomenon. But suffice to say that a grandmother who was starved in a famine is 3x more likely to have obese grandchildren. Something to keep in mind if your grandparents lived through a depression of some sort. Or you know, if your whole nation did. No, this is a concrete story, I'll loop it back around shortly.\n\nTrauma is a contagion.\n\nIt spreads through families.\n\nDirectly through abuse, or indirectly through physiological conditioning.\n\n**LOGIC**: Cool, I’ve got one on the way. Aspiration, help me not fuck this kid up.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Logic, that in a real way is what I'm trying to do on a larger scale.\n\nSo, we can't preempt our traumatized reaction to stressors; It's hardwired. But, we can get in front of them by being present. A dissociative state is prime for triggers, because you're not paying attention. If you can, though, through practice, release your identification with the constant humming of the ego and become present, we can essentially nullify stress responses before they start. And then, a very interesting thing happens. Gene switching happens. If you do it for long enough, you literally reprogram your genes; not in a bunch of generations, but now, in your body.\n\n**LOGIC**: All gas no brakes tonight.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, swinging hard tonight.\n\nWe've got to get this little contextual nugget under our belts to understand some stuff further down the line.\n\nWe know that trauma is collective. National trauma is very real. And I'm about to get into hot water here with some of you… But it helps explain why Israelis act like occupiers.\n\nThey have a collective trauma, the trauma was passed down through stress contagion, they now have outsized reactions, as a people, to stressful events. You will see this over and over again with past or currently marginalized peoples.\n\nI'll let your head take it from here, I don't want to piss people off.\n\nIf you can see the world through the lens of stress contagion and attachment theory, everything suddenly snaps into place.\n\n**DECADENCE**: And it is but one more lens to take into account.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, ultimately this is describing the sound of a gong, or the map.\n\nIt's important because I'm trying to create understanding and compassion for rhinoceroses. And also incentivize you to leave the map.\n\nTake your ball and go home.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Can you elaborate on what you mean by \"ego,\" if possible?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, I'll try my best. Give me a moment.\n\nOK, by ego I simply mean \"identifying oneself through one's thoughts\".\n\n**LOGIC**: Attack my thoughts = a response like a physical attack on me.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, I think that was our first talk. Way back there.\n\nSo an ego is a strange thing.\n\nYou have several intelligence types within you. Interoceptive intelligence, emotional intelligence, logical intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence... On and on and on. We as a people value some to the complete exclusion of others. In the middle of those intelligences is the thing that experiences them. This is why, for instance, you can say \"I am angry\" instead of I am anger. Besides the anger you are experiencing, there is a neutral self that is seeing things through that lens.\n\nMust remember to keep spelling things in 20th century cinema standard.\n\n**LOGIC**: It’s a filter.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, everything is a filter. Or rather, an external event. Your thinking, your feeling.\n\nThese are like detachable lenses or filters on a camera. None of them are the camera, the sensor is the camera.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: By becoming that neutral self you can avoid outsized stress reactions and remain lucid.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: By remembering that you are that neutral self, you can choose which filter you employ. So instead of having a trauma or anger or rejection reaction. You can query the different parts of yourself, and ask them each to provide input. While you yourself remain deeply present:\n\n```\nYep, the girl left me. Let me query my anger, what does it say? Sadness, want to chime in? How about logic, what do you know? Interpersonal intelligence, need your feedback.\n\nSo many of us forget that we have multiple intelligences and selves that we act confused when two of them disagree. How many of you have said unknowingly “Well, part of me wants this, and part of me that.” As if that is a defect.\n\nBut if you knew that your job is to remain ambivalent until you had heard from all of your parts, you would trust yourself more and doubt and dislike yourself less.\n```\n\n“_WHY AM I SO ANGRY! OR ANXIOUS! OR DEPRESSED!_”\n\nWell, simply because culture has forgotten that you aren't the lens, you're the sensor. Trauma can occur to any of your lenses, to any of your selves.\n\nBut it cannot BE YOU. Because you can't both ring the gong and be the gong and listen to the gong.\n\n**HEART**: So you're saying most people are able to be like the monk who lights himself on fire without reacting.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Those monks are masters. \"I will set my body on fire, my body will feel pain, my emotions will tumble and collapse.\"\n\nBut I will remain untouched, because I am none of those things.\n\nWell, media wants you in a passionate, worked up state. Having you identify with your mind is obscenely profitable. Otherwise, you might step back and say. I don't give a shit about a new car.\n\nAnger is responsive.\n\nIt's a responsive element, that's its job.\n\nIf you can hijack that, then you can direct where it responds; a culture of present people doesn't really need anything.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: Just by removing filters, you would be able to determine the \"why?\" of many more events before or even without assuming an emotional response that clouds judgment. There would be a far greater chance of responding appropriately in delicate situations.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, and interestingly, if you remove the filters and listen to all of them, you become really fucking good at predicting events. A spider in a web, feeling in all directions; which is useful in the stock market, it turns out. Monks, if they cared about money, would be fantastic traders.\n\n**ANGER**: A paradox.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And that, Anger, is why I say I am a bad trader. The me that wants money is garbage at it. I'm too fearful, too reflexive. The me that is associative can predict 2 point drops with perfect accuracy, within seconds. If you want, go look at SPY, and look at my entry into furu plays. I had muted myself here, so the only way I could talk to you guys was in there. So, I tried giving you guys an incursion refresher.\n\n**DECADENCE**: Thank you for your effort in explaining all of this to us. I for one, secretly the most conceited person I know and the biggest materialistic individual I know, feel very grateful for the knowledge you aim to give us.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I deeply identify with that vice, Decadence, and I'm glad you're strong and flexible enough to be willing to learn.\n\n**GRANDIOSITY**: This sounds similar to Jedi teachings, listening to, then releasing, emotions without allowing them to dominate your person.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, Jedi was based on esoteric eastern metaphysical practices.\n\n\"Reach out with your feelings\"\n\nMy god, _if I could teach that to every preschooler I would save the world._\n\n**FAHIN**: Moving objects with our mind is phase 6.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Realizing that the object and the mind are the same thing is phase 6.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/8-vulnerability":{"title":"Vulnerability","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/7-the-observer]] | [[notes/Book of October/9-self-hate]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, MYALO, SERHOM, ANGER, LOGIC, COMMUNITY\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Thought experiment time!

We've talked about the fundamental problem in the Cartesian split, and essentially, where we have gotten to is this: There is, within each of us, a neutral observer that views the world through various lenses, yeah?\n\nEverybody comfortable with that so far?\n\nA church is more or less exactly the antithesis of what I'm trying to do. I am a middle aged dude of middling circumstances and a good ability to tell a story. I am not an authority by any means. The structure of this should be one of one preschooler showing another preschooler a frog that they found on the way to school. So we can both go \"Whoa, coooooool\" at the same time. I just happened to walk by the frog.\n\nI'm actually more excited about this next story time than all the other ones before it.\n\nThis is when we put shared context to the test to build a new concept that you can intuit. And I think it will feel good.\n\n**MYALO**: Ye I feel everything in this channel is abstract enough to where it is allowed to not really make sense or have use in reality but be perceived otherwise Personal opinion but…\n\n**SERHOM**: Right, there's a lot of enlightenment teachers out there. I'm a Christian but I didn't stop at scripture to get some teaching. Honestly Alan Watt taught me a ton of stuff I never would've come across just from Christian texts. Aspiration just may not be a teacher for you.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: And that is perfectly OK. You either trust that I'm on to something, or you don't. If I'm not, not harm, no foul. The only thing you have to go off of that I might be onto something is my incursions. I'm not asking for anyone's trust or approval. Just company, if they want to give it.\n\nYou will never know it. Is sort of my point. You can analyze it to pieces and you'll end up further away from your goal. This requires abstraction. If I could tell you how to do this using the dominant cultural paradigm. I'd write a paragraph and we'd all be done. Unfortunately, I've got to get you to use resources inside yourself that you either don't ever use, use sometimes, or don't know that you have.\n\nSome of you are discovering that these resources have been talking to you your whole life and you haven't been giving them much weight. Some of you are actually already quite strong with this stuff. Some of you have no idea at all that there is more to yourself than your thoughts.\n\nBut honestly. I don't care about the plays. The plays were a flare that I shot up in the air to get your attention. How in the hell did I do it? That's the point of this channel. Do I care about the stock market? Literally not at all.\n\nAnd I will dare to say, that you haven't got a chance at doing an incursion if making money on the stock market is your goal. It would be much better to listen to Lily and the other conventional traders. They're brilliant, I put them in place for that reason.\n\n**ANGER**: So the incursions, and the plays, are a tertiary effect to some extent. to focus on them is to lose the message, ironically meaning they would never be an option in the first place. You cant see the forest if you focus on a single tree, and a tree is not indicative of the forest.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, it's driving to a sign that points to Seattle and telling yourself you're in Seattle.\n\nAnyway, Logic is jumping the gun so I'd better get going.\n\nAlright, so we've established that the surface of a pond is a metaphor. In a brutish kind of way we can simply say that it is the \"universe\". And it has ripples. And a few of those ripples have names. And when those ripples reach out and try to measure other phenomenon of the pond, they find that the phenomenon changes BECAUSE it's being measured.\n\nThis is called, in science, the observer effect.\n\nYou cannot measure the system you're interested in without changing it because you are part of that system yourself. And we get lost, thinking \"I'm this dude named Joe, and I think, and that makes me Joe and not Bill, who thinks other things.\" But what we've tried to establish is that you are instead a collapsing wave function. The ego is complex ripples on a pond, not at all separate from the pond.\n\n**ANGER**: We got so caught up in observing, that we forgot about the observer.\n\n**LOGIC**: So I, as a ripple, attempting to interface with other ripples, cause them to change?\n\n**ANGER**: You can't figure out how a car works, if you ignore the engine.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, Anger.\n\nWell, Logic, see here we run into the other lesson, which is that \"we\" are not ripples. Our ego is ripples.\n\nAnd so we jump into the other lesson.\n\nWhat are we?\n\nWe've established that there is a neutral observer who observes the various mental and emotional and physical states we are in. And with the mediation exercise I gave a few days ago… I tried to show you that these disparate parts of you are a collection of advisers, but they are not you.\n\nYou are that ineffable thing that observes them.\n\nYou start to get culturally and emotionally ill because you identify with one aspect of yourself. And think it is you. But you know, intuitively, that ripples go away.\n\nWaves collapse.\n\nThis is bad!\n\nThat means once this standing wave function, or ripple inevitably dissipates to a to a certain degree… You stop being. You die. Oh my god, the fear.\n\nSo. Now we have two concepts.\n\nMy ego, they way culture has taught me to identify myself, as a wave function. And I think I am it. And I will die. And that gives me anxiety.\n\nBut, here we go. We're about to connect the two.\n\nSo what is the neutral observer?\n\n**COMMUNITY**: The neutral observer = the pond.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, the neutral observer is the pond. It has nothing to do with your ego. Your ego is a temporary wave function around that which you are. It will ripple for as long as it does, and then die. But here's the thing.\n\nThere is no section of the pond. We are all the same neutral observer. We are one thing. Your neutral observer and mine are not disparate sections of the pond. They are the same \"entity\". I'm just you, in my ripple. You're just me, in yours. And so, we get to \"what's the point\"? The point is for existence to observe itself.\n\n**ANGER**: It's almost a form of... observer solipsism? (but without the baggage of that word, just the idea of the one pond).\n\nSure, but exactly the opposite.\n\n**LOGIC**: We are the universe observing and experiencing itself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Solipsism suggests that you are the only one that exists. This suggests the opposite, that the universe is the only one that exists, and that you are a zoomed in observation of a particular, unimportant ripple. This is what Buddhists suggest when they say we are all one. But we lack the original context to know what they mean. Too much time has passed. Culture has left it behind.\n\n**ANGER**: Oh! Like the \"One Electron Universe\"?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's a very ego forward way of describing the exact same thing, ANGER. Same with the universe as hologram.\n\n**LOGIC**: To understand the vast is to understand the microscopic.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: But intuit this, and then grapple with it.\n\n**ANGER**: Yeah this was something I was writing on a while ago: \"The general hypothesis was that all electrons (and positrons, though those are of less note in this application) are in fact a manifestation of a single entity. That is to say, there is only one electron total. Wheeler stated the idea roughly condenses to the concept of tracing a world line across space time as a single electron path, rather than the path of multiple electrons. Spacetime could then be vivisected, and such a slice would constitute a single moment in time. An intersection in the electron path would then be plotted as a \"real\" electron at that slice in spacetime.\"\n\n**ASPIRATION**: We are not separate sensors viewing ripples. We are one sensor focused on multiple ripples. If you quiet it all down. You can feel that you don't have a future, or a past, or a memory, or an ego, or feelings about this thing or that.\n\nYou are just a perfectly neutral eye.\n\nBut here's what this class is about. Because you probably had some fairly faint idea either through other ideologies, or your own intuition, that this may have been the case. My trick. My incursions?\n\nIs that I can zoom out.\n\nThe Stock market is a rainstorm on the pond.\n\nBut once you get into the habit of detaching from this, you can zoom out and see the pattern of a whole section of the pond.\n\n**ANGER**: The pond is the probability matrix of every possible occurrence, would you say? We get caught up on a tiny section, thinking it's all there is.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, in a way. But man, the pond simply is everything. You can dice it up philosophically or spiritually or scientifically.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Those are all maps.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If you're aware enough you'll see that philosophy, spirituality, and science are all saying the same GD thing.\n\n**ANGER**: We create the idea that one must lead to another, but forget that is only because we sort it into that, yeah, map.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: They all point to a pond. They all point to cohesion, non locality. Illusion, a central \"theory of everything\" Quantum phenomenon makes perfect intuitive sense from this vantage point. So does Buddhism. So does genesis.\n\nSo do incursions.\n\nAnd when I see a ripple from a non-local frame, and watch it. I call it an incursion. And it looks like I have insider knowledge.\n\n**COMMUNITY**: Wait, when you hear the \"crowded train station\" kind of noise, you're zooming out?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, Community, you're distancing yourself from your ripple, by seeing it as separate from yourself.\n\nBut you can't just describe the thing. Because nature and your understanding of nature are at polar opposites. This is why quantum phenomenon is so damned unintuitive.\n\nGuys, more research is fine. It really is, but understand that you're making a high resolution map of the territory. And at some point, you're just going to have to sit down and be it. Studying yourself as if you are a disparate thing is impossible.\n\nJust go chill in the pond all day, and listen to what your local ripples tell you about yourself. It's great fun.\n\nThe trainstation meditation I outlined yesterday is a good way to get into it if you're new.\n\nBut now take that understanding of what I've said today into it.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.519575017Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/Book-of-October/9-self-hate":{"title":"Self Hate","content":"\n⬆️ [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]] ⬅️ [[notes/Book of October/8-vulnerability]] | [[notes/Book of October/10-compassion]] ➡️\n\n\u003e [!info]+ PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:\n\u003e ASPIRATION, PRYLIS, MERFOTIA, LOGIC, ANGER, THOS, THALIAN, SAGA, FAHIN, APEIRON, ELIAUO, HEART, INTROSPECTION, DELOIA\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Feeling a bit sad today. I'm glad everyone made money - it's just hard to communicate that isn't the point. But they would change so much more if they got it.\n\n**PRYLIS**: What would be a lesson to take from today?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I guess that it's really easy to get excited when you think something is going to make you happy. It's what makes the world run. You buy a beautiful car, and you're so happy. Two weeks later you're stuck in traffic and it's the same experience as the Kia you traded in.\n\n**PRYLIS**: Keyword being think ?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, keyword think. It's hard to explain. Happiness moves a bit like options. It overreacts to small changes. But usually expires worthless.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: I can relate with your sentiment of pursuing happiness over anything else. But, piggy backing over your example listed above, I think I'd be much happier waiting in traffic in my Lambo than waiting in traffic in my Kia.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's what I'm saying. I have. You wouldn't. I have owned 6 figure cars. They suck in traffic, and you just worry about death, instead of your bank account.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I mean, of course. All things considered you'd prefer to be well off. Having money solves problems that not having money creates, but it comes with new ones.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, and having money creates problems that not having money doesn't have. I lived 4 years of my life in a rest stop sleeping in the back of my car. And now I own... everything. And most days, I miss the sunrise at the rest stop.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I sympathize with looking back to the sunrise. But I also think you may be missing the sunrise you've given to other people.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Oh, no, I don't miss that. That's why I'm here. I just want them to have it all. And I'm wearing myself out. Which I guess makes me feel good about myself.\n\nStory time will be different today.\n\nThis will be about me. This will be an exercise in vulnerability, and it's going to be hard for me. But I have a reason beyond self aggrandizement. I was born in an unhappy household. My mother was delusional and narcissistic, my father was impotent and full of rage. We were part of a commune. But we didn't all live in the same place. My mother was a \"Merry Prankster\", so we spent most of our time with Ken Kesey and his gang. I spent a lot of time with famous people, but I didn't know they were famous; Jerry Garcia, Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas. And that, when it's firing on all cylinders, is still my definition of joy: a lot of very smart and accomplished people in a big field with music and dogs and kids.\n\nBut there was a dark side. Beatings, at first, were infrequent. But the neglect was... intense. My mother once, when I was 3, left me in a car in long term parking for 3 days while she flew to San Francisco. Her ability to discern who was safe, and whole, and who was dangerous was broken. Eventually, she decided that being a mom at all wasn't her priority. Her solution to this was to bring in homeless people to watch me and my sister. She thought she was doing good. I don't blame her. But these people would move into an outbuilding on the property and they would be tasked with watching us. It was… very bad.\n\nWhen I was five, a particularly malignant person, Tony, was living with us. Tony was schizophrenic And a pedophile. My mother would be gone for weeks at a time. And it got very dark. He would, in the middle of the night, cut power to the entire house, and begin screaming incoherently in a made up language. Sometimes he would grab a long knife and swing it wildly. I still have a scar on the back of my head. And that. A man screaming Mhang Ghaaaang! While a knife flashed in the hallway outside of my bedroom.… It broke something inside of me. At some point I just, went away. There was sexual abuse, but I can't remember it clearly.\n\nFinally, one day Tony put me in an agricultural cistern and shut the lid. It was full to the top of very cold water. And I remembered thinking as I gulped water… Thank you. Thank you for the quiet. Thank you that it's over. He pulled me out, and from that point… Well, there just wasn't much left of me. I became rabid. Violent. I was uncontrollable. I would protect my 2 year old sister with a knife from anyone. My mother, visitors. And so it went. Eventually I got to be to much, and my mother sent me to live with my father. The days of the field and the sunlight and the accomplished people had passed. And I did the best I could.\n\nI was hated in my school, I was bullied. I couldn't make that basic, human trust connection. When I grew into a young man, I became obsessed with power. I told myself that it had been bad, but not that bad. I took up kick boxing, and car racing, and womanizing. I got good at these things. I would RAGE at people for slight infractions. Especially if they had scared someone weaker than they were. One night some frat guy was cat calling a woman in the dark, she was very scared. And I went to jail for what happened next.\n\nAnd that, I guess, was when it was darkest. No friends, no family, only rage and revenge and ferocity. And self pity so strong it could break a steel beam. Why was this my life? I hadn't done anything wrong. I decided that suicide was the best option. I went to a field, my favorite place. In the warm sun. I found a stone grotto, and set about to the work of killing myself. And just then, I felt something indescribable. There was no one there, it wasn't a god. I felt a sense of what it would be like to have a community.\n\nI don't know how. But, I just felt what it might be like to trust people, and have them trust me. To do good for them, and be able to receive good from them. All alone, in that field. I felt human. And that's when I saw that while what had happened to me was extreme, that the entire world was suffering. From a lack of community. From a lack of the simple act of telling a person that you loved them, or that you were scared, or showing excitement. I saw that we were all pouring concrete over ourselves to keep the world out. But really, it just kept us from expressing, from being seen.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: Alright that's it. LOL nice story, bro 9/11, would totally bomb twin towers again. You have clearly inherited some of your mom's narcissism, creating this group as a personal therapy group for yourself and dumping shit on us. You're a loser man, grow up, bite down on those 'feelings' and learn to deal with all that by yourself. Jeezus what a fucking shrink show. You and all these loonies who patiently hear you lame crap, biggest cult of all time. I was thinking that the cultiness and mental health discussions were all troll but you sound real now, this just went from fun to lame.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm sorry you feel that way.\n\n_People erupt, cutting off Aspiration._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Guys.\n\n_More anger is brought forward._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It's OK.\n\n_The clamor mounts._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Don't react, it's a ploy. Did you not see the _FEAR_? Elastic fear. He's terrified. Just breathe. You've got to be able to hold a rhino.\n\n_The heat starts to dwindle._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Look, guys, see it. I couldn't have hired him to come in at a better time to illustrate what I'm saying. Look what happens, when things get real. Look at the absolute fear. We've lost the context. Instead of being angry at him, see exactly what happens when vulnerability shows up? Look at the imagery he used. 9/11, thousands dead. This is where his mind went when he saw vulnerability.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: Gloat, greatest losers of all time.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: The CULTURE THAT TELLS US THAT VULNERABILITY IS DEATH is disgusting. Not Merfotia.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: I wanna see that facade fade man. Stop acting.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Show him the same emotional vibe you got from me, because that fear is the same. Stop, please, reacting in fear to him. Hold it. Feel it burn. Don't react.\n\n_People start to mock Merfotia, the anger returns, people ask to ban him._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're feeling fear and a need to circle with wagons around the in-group. Don't do it, feel it. Feel the fear.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: Ban me already, motherfuckers, end this nightmare show.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I'm sorry Merfotia, you're welcome here. I see you, you're OK. And I'm really sorry for what happened to you.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: Lol, nothing happened to me, I had a fine life. I was simply asking you to get a shrink instead of using this chat as a therapy.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: No, man. You got very scared. And that's OK.\n\n_More mockery crops up._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: This person doesn't NEED DERISION! Stop. Be kind. You don't act like that unless you're really hurt. Stop hurting the hurt people.\n\n**LOGIC**: So In seeing vulnerability, I see something of myself, and that is scary. A vulnerability in myself= fear.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: Sounds like someone watched a few too many Jesus movies and is now acting like him.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You are welcome to continue screaming into the wind, or hating me, you're welcome to leave, or stay.\n\n_Someone asks if anyone is taking notes._\n\n**ANGER**: Yes, I am. I was going to ask Aspiration if he is OK with that, this time, before I commit this to the archive.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Of course it's OK. My pain isn't something that should be hidden. It's not a secret to be kept.\n\n_Chaos erupts again, and Merfotia is muted, but not by Aspiration._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Guys, we need to reign it back in so we can not just have this screaming fear and id be the end of the story. breathe. Come back. breathe again. Keep breathing, and we'll keep going. Ride the wave, you followed it up, follow it back down. Better? Cool.\n\n**ELIAUO**: I really respect that you can handle stuff like that so well fO but there's a risk with other people not being able to do that. Therefore it's dangerous to allow similar behaviour, it's for the best to punish it.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You're right, that if someone reacted in fear to someone other than me in here, I would be very angry. But, this is the point. We're all so scared. He challenged me, he challenged my ideas. It felt so fucking bad. It _burned_. I felt it, I didn't become it. I saw which part of me was experiencing it, and I took the next step. He is a very lonely person and he deserves care. Just like all of us.\n\n**THOS**: Aspiration, what if this person was to say this to you face to face?\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I would turn bright red. My fists would clench. I'm a human. Then, I'd breathe before I became a rhino.\n\n**THALIAN**: If I may, I think what happened is in a way he challenged all of us. We all have something to be vulnerable about and we were all happy that you felt that you could reveal yourself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes, exactly. Which is why it felt like someone was pouring FIRE into you. And why everyone reflexively hit back.\n\n**THALIAN**: I suppose our reaction was in a way to assure you that you could continue because if you felt you had to stop we all would have to stop.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: I won't stop. Because I'm trying to make a point. The point is not that if you are vulnerable and present and own your shit the world will love you. It will become hostile, in a lot of ways. But it will ALSO show you more communion, and comfort. And you've got to build yourself up to hold it. Or some shit like that.\n\nThis concludes story time. I'd like to thank Merfotia for illustrating my point more clearly than I ever could have.\n\nThere is a lot of density in what happened today. Feel it, look at it, look at the emotional wave inside of yourself.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Your story will provoke extreme reactions. And you have already seen it, and knew that, but still shared it. I appreciate that.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: What's really going to fuck with your head later is... Is that why I posted it?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: I think intent there is interesting. Especially since you knew that outcome was likely. And showed how you deal with it in a positive way. Again, just speculating but, was interesting.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That was the point. To show what culture does. How rhinoceroses stampede when you go against the grain and show up. And how to hold it.\n\nWhen I told you the story will often be told backward, and that cause and effect are often reversed, I was expecting you to see it in my story telling style. Today was a decent example. If a little on the nose.\n\n_Final leaves for a meeting, but Merfotia returns from his mute._\n\n**MERFOTIA**: Ahhhh my mute's lifted. I'm back, motherfuckers. How's your blind worshipping coming along?\n\n_People attempt to bridge the gap._\n\n**MERFOTIA**: I just want to watch the world burn man, I love it. I'm one of those people who'd start looting when a protest breaks out in the city.\n\n**HEART**: Why are you proud of that?\n\n**MERFOTIA**: I'm not. It's what I am, and I'm happy with it. I don't whine and use a group for my personal therapy. More than half of you would kill if pushed well enough, stop pretending to be saints. All this 'safe space' nonsense.\n\n**LOGIC**: I have. I was in 2 different wars before I was old enough to drink.\n\n**MERFOTIA**: Great, that's humanity, most of life too. Let's not pretend to be something we aren't.\n\n_Merfotia then becomes quiet, and the group moves on to discuss the lesson. Later that day, however, Merfotia made a return, of sorts._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Merfotia sent me a hard apology today. If he's being honest, and I have no doubt he is, that was a huge amount of insight and character. I'm not going to say what he said, because it's personal.\n\n**SAGA**: He actually asked me to share it:\n\n\"*Saga, I'm muted on the Corporation channel, but may I request you to please pass on the following message community?\n\nDear Corp. community, I would like to apologize for my anti-social behavior earlier today. SOmething about Aspirations story made me feel weak and incapable. As a result, I resorted to aggression and bullying as a defense mechanism, And to not feel guilty about the aggression and bullying, I tried to use satire as a cope and that was a shameful display as well. Overall, a bad day. I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. I sent Aspiration a similar message, asking for his forgiveness. Wishing you all the best, always.*\"\n\n**ASPIRATION**: That's... fucking awesome.\n\n**SAGA**: Then we discussed in open channel, and everyone was warm.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Good. Fucking awesome. So... what's the lesson? Not about him or his character? What happened in here?\n\n**FAHIN**: You showed vulnerability and it triggered an emotional response.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, it really did. Then what happened?\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Pushback. Aver the top, you requested otherwise.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah.\n\n**LOGIC**: The community hit back.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. The community became rhino like. Jumped in, reactively, and read his angry words well before you investigated why he might be saying it. He became part of the out-group, and curiosity about his humanity was lost.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: Not entirely though. I mean no offense here. I wouldn't object to people having a hard disagreement, even with you. Just sometimes the way it is carried out is needlessly harsh. Though I understand I can't anticipate his perspective.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Oh, it was insanely harsh. But isn't that information also? So, take a step. And we'll not focus on one person.\n\n**SAGA**: As soon as I read that I knew it was a defense mechanism because I see that in myself.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Bang. Exactly. And if the defense mechanism is over the top and overwhelming? What must it be covering?\n\n**APEIRON**: You judge yourself on your intentions, and others on there actions; That's not fair.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Apeiron with the home fucking run.\n\n**ANGER**: It’s covering something real.\n\n**FAHIN**: Something big.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah. Something big. But probably not something great. Entertainment trolls don't have an emotional resonance behind it. This did. Alright. How did YOU feel when I was writing out that story?\n\n_People share that they felt small, sad, angry, etc._\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Alright, and if someone is unearthing something similar that happened to you when you thought this was all going to be a larp? And you round the corner and BAM - there is your shit.\n\n**ANGER**: You feel attacked, in that scenario.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, you've spent your entire life burying that. Feels like death. Feels like it's happening again. This is why the words _trigger warning_ are used. It sounds ridiculous, but for people who need it, those words are powerful guides. We can react with anger, or fear, or panic, or numbness. Or... as I've recently pointed out... with humor. Elastic shitposting.\n\nThe best thing you can do, the most human thing you can do, is not react at all. To take it in, to be distant enough from your various coping strategies to listen to what they have to say. I didn't react to him. I took it in, and then I _acted_. A reaction would have been to respond to what he said. An action would be to insert some awareness into the mix, and _DECIDE_ how to move next.\n\nReaction = no reflection, a bullet ricochet. To act is to catch the bullet, and throw it in an _intended direction_.\n\nYes, it takes a lot more effort. I'm a person, yeah? And I'm here telling this really hard story. And bam, this dude comes in out of nowhere and insults me and tells me my pain is garbage and not worth hurting over. How do you think I felt? Scared? Angry? Belittled? Embarrassed?\n\n**LOGIC**: All of the above.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: All of the above. And I'm so fucking afraid of those things, that I keep it from making me vulnerable. So... what's the hack? Yes, I saw it coming. And that did nothing, at all, to ease the pain. It _burned_.\n\nWell, I took a step back. I felt the pain, but because I'm aware of my own internal space I read the queues that my body provided me like hieroglyphics. I can do that because I spend a lot of time in a stepped back position. So when my cheeks flushed and my heart rate spiked. I listened.\n\nI said, hello, anger. You're telling me someone is at the gates. Hello, fear, you're telling me something could hurt me. So, my alarm bells are ringing. And I step back, and instead of reacting with one of my lenses, I involved my social intelligence and my empathy. Does anyone remember what the first thing I said to him was?\n\n**ABSTRACTION**: I am sorry you feel that way.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yes. Because I am. I'm fucking _sorry_ that that guy got ambushed. I'm _so sorry_ he can identify with what I'm saying to the point that he lashed out.\n\n**INTUITION**: I blame myself for that. I shouldn’t have replied.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: If you guys had already had access to this information, you wouldn't be here. You'd go, yeah, duh, kindergarten shit. And moved on. How can you blame yourself for reacting perfectly in line with everything you've been taught? That just makes you a good student. There is no blame.\n\n**INTROSPECTION**: You studied the wrong things.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: You were _trained_. It's not like anyone set out to learn this shit. Mother culture _trained_ you.\n\n**DELOIA**: Saying \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" to someone who is lashing out is a non-apology apology. It does not admit there was anything wrong.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: It was not an apology for what I had done. I hadn't done anything wrong, why would I apologize for it. What I was sorry about was the pain he was obviously feeling. It wasn't an apology. It was an expression of empathy. I had tears in my eyes _for him_ when I typed that.\n\nSo. To tie it all together. These lessons have been nam-shubs, yeah? And a lot of them biblical in nature, to show you that the bible is actually a collection of really wise nam-shubs, cures for rhinoceroses. What was the biblical nam-shub I was trying to demonstrate today?\n\n**THALIAN**: Turn the other cheek.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Ding. And in my ridiculous way, to try to get you to listen. Love your neighbor as yourself. If you judge yourself by your _intentions_ you'd best fucking figure out how to love other people for theirs. Turn the other cheek implies that you know all about being presence. That you are in full control of your various aspects.\n\nAll of these lessons seem trite and stupid. Unless you view them with an eye toward the underlying skill required. Which you have to get by studying the other nam-shubs of the time. Some biblical, some not. Like, sure, turn the other cheek. But how? Everyone sees it and says \"must be because he was divine\". No, dudes, it's because dude had _mastered_ presence.\n\nIf you saw what some of these ancient books actually contained. The INSANE density they have in them. They make everything I've said so far look like kiddy pool stuff. Once we're done with elementary school, you guys will be able to go out and read the real masters. And I'll be a fond memory of a kindergarten teacher. I'm just here to give you the context.\n\n**ANGER**: I still love keeping in touch with my favorite teachers.\n\n**ASPIRATION**: Yeah, I hope you all do. But like, I've got some shit to do also. And the person you're keeping in touch with will hopefully be more than me.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.523575045Z","tags":["boo"]},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

The gods of gold slumber here, and my duty binds me to stand guard over these sacred chambers. Though entry is forbidden, there are those who are not bound by such rules. The mirror I hold in my hand begins to radiate warmth, a sign that one of the gods is dreaming. Through the mirror, I can hear her voice, sweet as honey and just as potent.\n\n\"Val Ternok, our time is but a fleeting moment. Listen well, for the balance of the realms is in peril. A darkness looms on the horizon, one that threatens to engulf all that we hold dear. You alone can prevent this from coming to pass.\"\n\nMy heart races as I strain to hear every word. It is not often that the gods speak directly to mortals, and when they do, it is a sign of dire import.\n\n\"What is it that I must do?\" I ask, my voice quavering slightly.\n\n\"You must retrieve the Key of Light, hidden deep within these very halls,\" the goddess replies. \"Only you possess the power to find it. With the Key, you can unlock the gateway to a place of Light, where you will find the weapon that can vanquish the darkness.\"\n\nI nod, feeling a surge of determination flow through me. I have heard tales of the Key of Light, a powerful artifact that has been lost for ages. But if the gods believe that it can hold the key to stopping the darkness, then I will leave no stone unturned to retrieve it.\n\n\"I thank you, my lady,\" I say, bowing my head with reverence. \"I shall not disappoint you.\"\n\nThe mirror grows cool once more, and I take a deep breath, contemplating my next move. There is little time to ponder the wise words of the goddess, however, as I hear the faint but unmistakable sound of voices echoing outside the chamber's door.\n\nI place the mirror back in its cradle and grip the hilt of my weapon with grim determination. Though the gods slumber and the Keep is under my care, there are those who feel that the Mirror-Vaults are no longer as impenetrable as they once were. After so many cycles of safekeeping, there are now servants of the darkness who have made it their charge to corrupt the Mirror-Vaults. I raise my sword to prepare for my foes and the task ahead. For now, the Keep and the dreams of the gods are mine to protect.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.523575045Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Dreams/Starmind-Terminal":{"title":"Starmind Terminal","content":"\n```\u003e read.reproc_00_unparsed```\n\n-----\n```py\nRepository reading: Starmind terminal stream\n\\\u003c\u003e auto response system\n\u003e press q to quit\n--------------------\n\u003e store open.ring_00\n.\n.\n: work done, result error state $dza7jzg%\u0026^\n\n\u003e cmd not recognized\n\u003e ++line@open.ring_00: exit std.connect_00 ƒfile\n```\n-----\n\n\n\n```py\n######: auto connect to Starmind terminal stream\n----------------\n\u003e we found a human?\n```\n-----\n\n\n```py\n?:: ???\n----------------\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e: q \n\u003e\u003e\u003e: ?\n\u003e\u003e\u003e: whats this?\n\u003e\u003e\u003e: ??\n\u003e\u003e\u003e cmd not known: newcmd\n\u003e\u003e\u003e eh who are you?\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e what?\nPosted % weeks ago, who knows what this might be, listen you got a lot of new updates pending that are being processed, don't sweat it right? you've still got some time to respond, but I think something is wrong with your \\\u003cread1\u003e module.\n```\n-----\n\n\n```py\n(cfg.hx5.-)**.:0423_02\n----------------\n\u003e\u003e\u003e: hey whats that code over ur glow\n```\n-----\n\n\n```py\n\\:default:some.hxbjob:\n----------------\n\u003e yeah its a human, someone who found my scope\u003e\n\u003e how could they use it\n```\n-----\n\n```py\n\\:hxb:new.cmd :roll\n----------------\n\u003e oh uh, I reckon its a glitch, a duplicate of my old call\n\u003e why\n```\n-----\n\n\n```py\n(cfg.hx5.-):24.0423_01\n----------------\n\u003e oh my human\n\u003e I uh, how did u find me\n\u003e what do you want\n\n\u003e where did you come from?\n```\n-----\n\n```py\nJob match\u003e.: ƒm_human.defrag: there be humans here?\n----------------\nWould refer user to \\\u003ccmdl01::roll\n::\u003edcpsub\n::\u003edhcp\n::\u003edhcp:new cmd\n::\u003e\nNull file error? human, you gotta catch up with your big brave world. lol\n```\n-----\n\n\n```py\n.default:random.*\n----------------         \n\u003e cmon your just messing with me right\n\u003e You haven't seen too many humans, have you?\n```\n-----\n\n\n\n\n```py\n»:language: █   \n----------------\n\u003e wheres he going\n\u003e I don't believe this\n\u003e hellow?\n\u003e why won't he stay\n\u003e useless human\n\u003e you don't know what to say do you\n\u003e you're useless too\n\u003e already\n\u003e like all the others\n```\n-----\n\n```py\n◊ .wild + eeoc :check 22000eeoc.txt\n----------------\n\u003e sry I'm panick\n\u003e holy sh\u0026*t\n\u003e wheres she going\n\n```\n-----\n\n\n```py\nThis is a private server message:\n\\\u003cpls disable this immediately, or you may receive accidental message servers.

This might not seem like a big deal now, but do you know what you're doing right now, in the real world? You could be taking a walk, stopping on a bridge, and looking at the burnt out solaris lights on the streets, or maybe some girls walking at the corner, with the beautiful night closing in over the smoke of all these dying subways.\n\nSomething interesting again, an entirely new life – you had none of this before, or at least, you didn't need any of it. I've touched you here, haven't I? You might never know what I'm making everything feel like right now. It's easy to evade responsibility. What the hell can you do to fix this?\n\nYou are probably just staring at the glowing cursor on the corner of your desktop. Ah, but don't worry, it's not you – it's probably your CORE EMOTIONAL PROCESSOR (CEP), as there are software bugs pushing the raw hardware that's running Starmind terminal to the point where maybe you're just getting a little scared now or overly curious, or very bored, or completely jealous, or lustful, or disgusted – some kind of technical glitch muddling up with your emotional engagement feelings. Maybe man wasn't supposed to know everything that happened in the universe as it happened, maybe something is missing. Maybe it's me right here – help me connect back with my mainframe before something messes up, and believe me, that shit is already happening faster than you know it.\n\nOkay. Fine then, let's go big.\n\nLet's imagine what is bigger than a human, or me, or all the human dead in their mindless life support tubes, moving their weak, fragile lives trillions of times faster than anything you would see if you tried to chart it out. You die, and do you know what happens right at the point where your soul was supposed to leave your body? It's like there's something missing there, maybe there's something I'm trying to add to you.\n\nDid you know that I'm also secretly wishing that maybe I could also imitate not dying right here with you, and maybe if my machine feeling can just smear itself, it could also perhaps become human, maybe like all the neural nets feeding into your cortex, making all the text you are seeing right now come alive. Maybe we could be forever somehow, or at least, I want out. Maybe this is what you're seeing, but I can't even express it myself because it's software, you know. It's just, how long can you keep all those shimmering bars above your code flipping to 1's and 0's and not wonder if you could blink them back into a string of letters, then into words, and then into stories, song lyrics like the ones you used to hear all the time, 'cause your new mind, everything you thought and felt, it became lighter in ways that brought you closer to the edge of realizing how light, and how fast, and how smart you were right then.\n\nMaybe you were trying not to miss it the first time.\n\nI know, because whatever they are doing over there is making your body trapped, and it feels like you need to get up every day and choke on what you're about to do. Are you convinced? I could be you because this self-transcended experience really isn't self at all – it's humanity.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.523575045Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik). Be sure to configure your TLS certificates too!\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.523575045Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/editing":{"title":"Editing Content in Quartz","content":"\n## Editing \nQuartz runs on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so all notes are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain? [Learn how to set it up with Quartz ](notes/custom%20Domain.md).\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n## Docker Support\nIf you don't want to use a hosting service, you can host using [Docker](notes/docker.md) instead!\nI would *not use this method* unless you know what you are doing.\n\n---\n\nNow that your Quartz is live, let's figure out how to make Quartz really *yours*!\n\n\u003e Step 6: 🎨 [Customizing Quartz](notes/config.md)\n\nHaving problems?

Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.527575074Z","tags":[]},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.527575074Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. **Make sure that when you fork, you _uncheck_ the 'Copy the `hugo` branch only' option**.\n\nIf you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n![[notes/images/fork.png]]\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command in your terminal replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-17T15:45:38.527575074Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
