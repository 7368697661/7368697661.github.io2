In these pages are kept [[notes/edits/Shapes in the Noise]]; for all time, for ages, for countless generations.

In these pages are kept poor imitations of other people's fine words, [[notes/Book of October/0-the-book-of-october]]; that are closer to what I believe but never can I speak.

In these pages are kept dreams for you to read; [[notes/Dreams/dreams_index]] papers, essays and the scratching notes I made while writing them.

In these pages are kept wires, dreams in parallel hypnogagial existence; [[notes/Abaddon/the-stair]] projections of what could be, what must be.

In these pages are kept fictitious events and characters; **[████████]**;stories which articulate far more than I ever could.

In these pages are kept my souvenirs; precious, **[████████]**;cherished moments with people lost, who will never again be.

In these pages are kept the shards, of plans and threads, long broken apart. **[████████]**;whatever used to be is now lost.

In these pages are kept the seeds of passion, frustration and wonder; unlocked **[████████]**;words which aim to capture the unknowable.

In these pages are kept the glimpses I've had, borrowed confidence and epiphanies; while **[████████]**, perhaps then I will write.

In these pages are kept my memories; dreams and memories of dreams, **[████████]**;to sift through the shards of my mind.

In these pages are kept those whom I have honored, mortals and Gods alike; **[████████]**; a testament to what they meant to me.

In these pages are kept lives, defined and shattered; given shape, **[████████]**, to become real, in the hearts and minds of others.
