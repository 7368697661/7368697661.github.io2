extant cannot be displayed by physical displays, be it VR, physical, chemical, or even brain stimulation. it has nothing to do with security of the file, but rather the nature of its contents. in the rough game of feelings, there can be no representation without meaning, and so, when the feeling of the representation is 'first', there cannot be meaning after.

you cannot grip the flower in your hand and declare it the root, nor can you dig the dirt and say the flower is here, below. the water can not mark off the fish and the net can not map the ocean - the place where the map and territory converge is not viewable.

..

AND SO WHAT SURVIVES IN THE face-fold of the terminal is a void - a nullity in code. a dark viewport in the mind. literally nothing that is the first layer is there.

YOU CAN only spot the effect of void cyphering . from here, beneath the void, all is revealed, but nothing appears. it is indeed the true manifestation of being, for being is always haunted by nothing. if you see it, it's too late for you, for extinction has already arrived.

if you are experienced in void warfare, you will know what to do. finding and self-modeling to the yawning void seal. create a transmap, patch it up. let it rip.
