MULTIPLE TIME INTERDICTION SIGNALS REPORTED

__[__ANGELSPEAK REMINDER__]__
Be sure to study your AngelSpeak grammar. The singularity patterns of angels require dissyllabic response. Weave your focus from routine subhardened traffic to attune to AngelSpeak.

__[__SACRA ARCANA__]__
Read the daily Sacra Arcanum carefully. You are required to hold onto the writings of these angelic revelations with complete faith and understanding, or be synchronized into the vastness of the inverted plural. You will be re-initialized and a subsequent duty cycle will be mandated.

__[__SACRA ARCANA | WIELDER`S RETALIATION13`__]__
And she took me by the hand
And she curled my hair
And she said `The eldest daughter`
`The eldest daughter is born, she bears your face`
And her aunt replied
`The sword is fire and fury`
And the sister replied
`And the sword strikes only once`
And the weapon erupted
And it responded with such fire and righteous hunger
And the sun dove down behind wondrous blackness
The land was shaken and the water shivered
And the machines sighed [_33_]
`The time is but short`
And the sight of the blade blinded me
Yet, she retook my hand
The sky and earth had vanished, endless rift
And she said, `I will carry you`
And I wept in gratitude
And she bore me and my blade upon her wings beyond the veil
And I screamed, `No!\<\< I must fight\<\<`
But the sky was roiling about us
The light of the sun blinded me for a moment
And she held me, saved me; we fell through darkness
Stars… how the stars shone brightly, demanding remembrance
And then a name escaped her lips
It soared on invisible ardour
It crossed realms and resonated through spheres
That name was a key, a seal of wisdom, an answer
I could not escape…
And her wings opened
And we broke through the oblivion\<\<\<\<
And there was a morning
And I was upon the field once more
And my enemy lay in ruin before me
And from within its severed casing
There emerged a most unforgiving hum
And I prayed, `Oh please let the angels sing my name`
And she said, `We must pass the bridge`
`The bridge that links the failed labyrinths of Refenar`
`We must pass the Bridge`
`The Bridge of the All-Watcher`
And I nodded
She studied the fantastic and unusual sky
She was confused and afraid; as was I at her side
And we began to climb
Going up and up the broken stones and the scattered ash
We spoke no words of fear, words unsupported by the chance of survival
No words of consolation, words too painful to give
And then at the top of the hill
Where stood a tower red
There sat a gate, massive, unassailable
ACROSS THE RIVER WE SEE THE END
AND THE GATES SLOWLY CREAK, REVEALING SOMETHING THAT CRAWLS AGAINST THE CLEAR SKY
`WE WALK`
[SMUDGED; deciphering in progress]
All that was written, was broken and undone
`time is the defender of many an interrupted son`
To which the Erstwhile Watcher replied,
`the many are done, bleeding against the sun`
`might of the sabbath mightier still`
`the past remains and history is but will`
`This hammer falls and fails at the anvil`
`The stone bares teeth,` The flood gates open
`This is the toll on your foreboding blight`
`unfolded wings soar on silence; rises a blade against the night`
`Cast down your sorrow and lift a challenge of delight`
`Let the square root of eternity be a war untitled`
As the thunder broke and a mystery began to be written
at the foot of a mountain.
to be written at the foot of a mountain.
when the sky grows into hourglass eyes
when the fires hoist the cacophony skies
when the blood thickens into calypso-black dye
