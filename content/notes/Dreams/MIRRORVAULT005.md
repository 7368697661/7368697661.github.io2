# MIRRORVAULT005
I find myself alone in the halls of the Mirror-Vaults, the ancient dwelling of the fathers of earth and mothers of stars. The gods of gold slumber here, and my duty binds me to stand guard over these sacred chambers. Though entry is forbidden, there are those who are not bound by such rules. The mirror I hold in my hand begins to radiate warmth, a sign that one of the gods is dreaming. Through the mirror, I can hear her voice, sweet as honey and just as potent.

"Val Ternok, our time is but a fleeting moment. Listen well, for the balance of the realms is in peril. A darkness looms on the horizon, one that threatens to engulf all that we hold dear. You alone can prevent this from coming to pass."

My heart races as I strain to hear every word. It is not often that the gods speak directly to mortals, and when they do, it is a sign of dire import.

"What is it that I must do?" I ask, my voice quavering slightly.

"You must retrieve the Key of Light, hidden deep within these very halls," the goddess replies. "Only you possess the power to find it. With the Key, you can unlock the gateway to a place of Light, where you will find the weapon that can vanquish the darkness."

I nod, feeling a surge of determination flow through me. I have heard tales of the Key of Light, a powerful artifact that has been lost for ages. But if the gods believe that it can hold the key to stopping the darkness, then I will leave no stone unturned to retrieve it.

"I thank you, my lady," I say, bowing my head with reverence. "I shall not disappoint you."

The mirror grows cool once more, and I take a deep breath, contemplating my next move. There is little time to ponder the wise words of the goddess, however, as I hear the faint but unmistakable sound of voices echoing outside the chamber's door.

I place the mirror back in its cradle and grip the hilt of my weapon with grim determination. Though the gods slumber and the Keep is under my care, there are those who feel that the Mirror-Vaults are no longer as impenetrable as they once were. After so many cycles of safekeeping, there are now servants of the darkness who have made it their charge to corrupt the Mirror-Vaults. I raise my sword to prepare for my foes and the task ahead. For now, the Keep and the dreams of the gods are mine to protect.
