It’s the wastes out here, worse than that, there’s a storm coming. You can see the plume of sand far off to the left, dark as night and coming far more quickly. Behind you, you hear the whine of a Gauss personnel defender rifle, a PDR-E, and the sound of flechette hitting the ground just to your right.</p><p><strong>Silent</strong> you think to yourself, you hadn’t heard them sneak up. <strong>Internal communication</strong>, these guys were pros. You dive forward, kicking up sand as you scramble over the nearby dune. Now in a prone position, rolling, you snap the stock of your rifle to your shoulder and aim through the scope. A hand flashes illuminated slightly through the scope. You squeeze. There flashes a metallic sound and a bright green line arcs through the sky as the bullet lodges in the ARC Solider. He screams, thrashes, and then disintegrates as the wires tear him to pieces, what’s left of him a pile of ash.</p><p>You jump up, scanning the horizon with your scope. Broken-down villages and vacant derelicts lay scattered across the horizon. The wind carries with it the haunting sound of a world sliding out of time. You duck back down, shallow breaths. You can feel the energy now, faint static against your bones. You flick open your neural display and see the source is drawing ever closer, the effect grows stronger as you ‘tune’ to the source. There. You see a narrow passage, in the sand. It cant be but three feet wide, just small enough to crawl through sideways.</p><p>You close your eyes, willing the information into your AR contacts. Four ARC troops and one shadowed presence behind them. There is something else, but you can’t see it yet. Light with the left leg, in case you need to jump. Your nanowires spread up your body, bluish sparkles all gathered tightly to you.</p><p>You stand fully, leveling your rifle and pulling a deep breath. The wind buffets you, scattering a handful of paper cutouts across the sands. You see him now, an ARC soldier not far away. “Hold it there, you’re&ndash;”</p><p>A sharp report and what’s left of him jump back slightly. You hear the gunshot and the rest of their mechmen scatter. They retreat. You waste no time, spinning on your heel and sprinting toward the passageway. As you near, a hand clutches the sand without sound. Each of your wires pulses sharply, making you drop to the ground as you slip through. You flip around, pointing your rifle at the entrance. Small shards of sand are knocked loose as you hear two sets of footsteps nearby. You fire as they pass the entrance, one sprays blood and the other screams, dissipating as your wires cut his skin. A small rain of wires follows in the wake of gray multilayered clouds. You barely get back as a purple gelatinous substance splats against the entrance, reacting with the sand and creating a shield that blocks the way. You pulse, sending half the wires to ram through the shield. They splatter on the other side.</p><p><strong>Outcompetitors. Fuck.</strong> You quickly shut your neural display, leaving the natural world to cloak your mind, eyes casting across the entrance. You readjust your scope, scanning the area slowly as you wait. Sweat streams down your face, and your hair, slicing across your vision as you aim. There is nothing there. Quickly, you place a grenade in the entrance and run further into the tunnel. A muffled explosion makes the ground rumble behind you. You duck low, pressing onward.</p><p>You run for a couple of minutes before reaching a wider tunnel, running tall by your side. Ahead of you, light shines down from a cracked ceiling, and a short flight of stairs leading down to an entrance made of tall standing stones. There is a small column of light that flashes before you as you enter the room, which is cavernous and vast. You see only the entrance, the broken mechanism clicking gears as the stones slide up, settling back into their grooved position as the pillars lock back into place. Good, you’re completely sealed off now, and however many entrances there are, damn, that’s going to be time-consuming for ARC.</p><p>You level your rifle again and listen, nothing behind you. You slink across the perimeter, your eyes scanning the vast but ultimately empty room. There is nothing but debris on the floor, and the occasional piece of broken crystal from one of the dull light shingles overhead. A wave of static energy rushes up your body again. <strong>Tuning</strong>. Turning slowly, you pull up your AR panel and see that the source is somewhere in the middle of the room.</p><p>“Where are you” You whisper, slinking across the space. The energy becomes stronger, distant murmurs growing louder. Shadows move behind metal objects, whispering and fading. Each side of the room is littered with hexagonal broken machinery. Gold lines at each end of the room and sections of crystal glow weakly from the floor. You stop in the center of the room, pivoting quickly. You hear the faint whir of a helicopter far outside and the thunder of distant explosions. You grit your teeth, wires slowly swaying, twisting your body as you step forward. An ever-present urge to just run away from this place growing within you. <strong>Keep calm, this is what you’re good at</strong>.</p><p>You slowly climb down a broken staircase to the far right of the room, using an old concrete vehicle as cover. You move cautiously. The room below you glows red and shimmers as if filled with smoke. <strong>Down we go</strong>, no choice, you can hear ARC getting closer. You slink out of cover, slipping along the wall as you move to the edge of the shattered stairs. You evenly descend the stairs in a crouch, stepping on shattered ladders and rubble. The stairs keep going. <strong>How deep am I?</strong> You wonder, having lost count of the steps long ago. After what seems like an eternity, you reach the bottom. A large section of metal fence is to the right, with a plethora of broken cables across the floor. Some cables rise, hung loosely from a small locker connected to the wall. You slink to cover as you duck behind a nearby pillar. <strong>What exactly did I find?</strong></p><p>A set of black doors looms nearby, enormous and wide with a large keyhole. You make your way over, finding it unlocked. You push the doors open, the smell of seawater rushing into the room. Another distant explosion in the distance. Your wires dampen the sound, leaving only the echoes of distant machines. You peer through the door, seeing a vast ocean stretching from a small harbor far below the edge of the room. You step onto the cobblestone floor and hear the sound of waves, a barely perceptible glare. You adjust your position and see shapes, glowing in the depth. There are thin metal walkways connecting ruins of airships and skyscrapers, once plush with people and technology but now they all lay dead and crumbling to the ocean. You catch the scent of burning cloth and machine parts over the salt. A wave surges outwards, washing over the ruins like a wounded beast and washing up on the cobblestones below. You scan the buildings, looking for anything.</p><p><strong>Cerin.</strong> You hear in your head. Stillness, and fear washing through you. <strong>Cerin.</strong> It says again. You can hear a vague echoing of breathing. None of it sounds human. You slowly turn, eyes scanning the room. Nothing is there. <strong>What the&ndash;</strong> You think to yourself, cutting yourself off abruptly. <strong>Who’s&ndash;</strong></p><p>Another wave crashes over the ruins. The noise fills the air, carrying a howl that wails like a foghorn. You see something, red light off in the distance under the water. <strong>I’m not jumping in…</strong> The thought hardly crosses your mind before you hear an explosion, closer this time. Suddenly, the water doesn’t seem so bad. You jump into the water, hitting the ocean with a dull splash. The water is ice cold and rushes past your ears as you sink into an ocean uninhabited for hundreds of years. You hear an explosion above you, distant and muted as if pressed against glass. There is immense weight and vast distance above you now. Your suit heats up, warming your body as you sink further into the depths.</p><p>Your adrenaline rushes in, your body sending a sudden charge of energy through your muscles as your mind settles into the situation. You scan the water, only seeing darkness, the vague blue outline of skulls on black and eerie shadow, haunting red flashing through the distance. <strong>What have I found?</strong> You think to yourself. Ahead of you, in the dark, there are towers of crystal and various half-sunken segments of ruins. Behind you, the dark, and whatever nightmare those ARC troops represent. Of one thing you are certain, this place, you’re not coming out the same way you came in.</p><p>You swim low to the ground, using the ruined concrete to guide your way under the fallen structures. There. In between two towers, there is a large gap, a shadow blocking the passage. Another explosion rocks the ruins, lights flash in the distance. You duck lower as a piece of debris flashes past, the cold shadow passing within inches of your hands. A narrow passageway lies ahead, you’re able to see that it ends in pitch blackness before dropping to oblivion. You are forced to let go, swimming down as you slip into a narrow gash that runs a short way before opening back up. There is a faint glow coming from ahead. You slow down, tightening your wires as you near.</p><p>Looking through, you see a red radiance, though the source still eludes you. The room is large, and you can see stairs ahead that lead further into the superstructure. <strong>How big is this place?</strong> You wonder. You slip in, feeling the squalid slickness of the stones under your hands. Releasing your grasp entirely, you swim in, pulling yourself towards the stairs. You enter, slowly swimming forward step by step. The walls seem <strong>scorched?</strong> Blackened, as if a blast had gone off. Debris floats by from above, a vivid red color reflecting the ambient red light below. The stairs continue to wind downward, its curvature almost imperceptible as you pass. A faint hum comes from below, a rhythmic beat that you can’t quite place. Nearing the bottom, water starts to rush almost formed streams beside you. Massive gears churn slowly, giant rusty monoliths that spin at a slow, almost torturous pace. You reach the bottom after a moment of discomfort and pull yourself clear of the waters into a hallway. Consoles lay in neat rows, dusty, but not destroyed. <strong>Strange</strong> you think. <strong>How did these escape the same destruction as everything above?</strong></p><p>More concerning, you notice all the doors in this hallway are locked.</p><p><strong>Boom</strong></p><p>That sounded far too close. The lights flicker as your vision snaps back to the water rushing by from the stairs above. <strong>It has to be draining somewhere.</strong> Your mind races as you rush over to search. <strong>There.</strong> A crack, roughly the size of your chest. Where the rock meets metal, you see glimpses of red light escaping through the crevice. To the left, a larger pipe lies swallowing the residual current. <strong>I can fit.</strong> Emptying your lungs of air, you hold your breath as tightly as you can. You squeeze yourself past the obstruction, squeezing through the gash with all your might. For a moment, you fear yourself to be stuck. You suck in a big breath and wriggle all the more. You squeeze free, finding yourself on the other side of a vast and ancient waterway. The walls are black and grim, covered with scorches. Debris litters the surface, some pieces perfectly severed, the others shockingly graphically ruined. It’s grisly, to say the least.</p><p>Above, you hear mechanical steps in the hallway.</p><p><strong>They’re here.</strong> Your wires brace, tight as ever against your small frame. <strong>How are they catching up so quickly?</strong> You start moving again. <strong>There has to be another entrance.</strong> Though you have to wonder just how deep you are. The room is massive, the ceiling lost in shadow far above. It seems almost impossibly large. Great pillars stand throughout, wrapped in gold with great carvings upon their surface. Along each wall are carved channels; in some lay gold, in others a red light. Ahead, through the darkness, you see strange moving walls of more glowing red light, pulsing as they rush from the pipes along the walls. The main channel in the center begins to move as well, slowly filling from the wall and creeping along ahead of you. <strong>Am I being sensed?</strong> You wonder. Soon, each channel is rushing over to converge upon an entrance ahead of you.</p><p><strong>Feeling exposed.</strong> You thought as you slipped into the channel, feeling it gently push upwards as it led you to a large door ahead. You gaze into the murk, catching vague glimpses of great alien machines. <strong>This is my only way out. I’m going to have to trust it.</strong> You push onwards, pressing your back against the wall. Your wire sparks, your mind shifting its circuits.</p><p>Whispers surround you again, the hair on your neck raising as the air cools considerably. The new room is dark, with a single red light glowing at the far end. Channels reach like fingers towards you, hundreds of cables laying across the floor; both pulsing with that red light. <strong>I don’t like this.</strong> You looked behind you, grabbing a building block and shoving it in front of the entryway. <strong>Don’t get trapped.</strong> You whispered to yourself. Carefully, you creep forward. The cable to your left sputters and zaps as you pass by it.</p><p><strong>Wait. It’s watching.</strong> You stop, the cable glows eerily in the darkness, pulsing like a heartbeat; now glowing brighter as you approach. You lift your hand, it pulses faster. You reach for a knife, and the glow disperses. You stand, for a moment, considering the cables. They’re intertwined so tightly. <strong>There has to be something here.</strong> And with that thought, you suddenly aren’t sure what to do. <strong>I need to find a way out</strong>, yes, but <strong>what else is down here?</strong> You continue down the hall, casting your eyes about quickly for any remnants. To the right, a pile of rubble. To the left, more cables lay, wrapping like snakes around the ruined floor. The walls are smooth and dark, the channels empty of the red light from the previous room. You stalk from pillar to pillar, slowly drawing closer to the end of the hall. The air is ice cold, if your breath wasn’t filtered you would see it hanging in the still air like clouds laden with snow.</p><p><strong>Cerin</strong> the voice again. You spin around, rifle tucked into your shoulder. Still, no one is to be seen. A slight panic starts to creep up your back, causing your breath to catch as you scan the room again and again.</p><p>“Who’s there?” You call out, but no one answers. “I’m armed, and I wont ask again.”</p><p>Your response is the drip of water, and the whispers that surround you. Straining your long ears, you struggle to make out anything but the language is not one you recognize.</p><p>“I said,” but before you can continue, you see her.</p><p>A woman, visibly your same age, laying at the end of the hallway. She lies on a sandstone altar, surrounded by a pool of black water. No, not water… <strong>Synstal</strong> you breathe, hardly believing your eyes. The stuff was worth many multiples its weight in gold, and here you had found, well, far more than you could ever carry.</p><p>Another explosion rocks the structure, and you narrowly dodge a chunk of stone as it falls. Suddenly the black metal lacing the walls makes more sense. <strong>Synstal, this whole place is made of it–good Sol almighty,</strong> a curse slips out. <strong>No wonder ARC would kill for this place. Not that they typically have issues with killing.</strong> Carefully, you scoop a bottle of it up and close the lid. The black metal, liquid in this form, shines with a golden luster, glowing faintly amber in the dim light.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>The voice makes you jump, your hand reaching for the sidearm strapped to your leg.</p><p>“Who are you?” It’s the woman. She’s awake now, sitting up and staring at you. You level the pistol, she cocks her head to the side.</p><p>“I could ask you the same thing, lady.”</p><p>She simply stares, then finally seems to recognize the firearm as a threat. Before you can move, a wire of red light wraps around the gun and it melts into two halves.</p><p>“Who are you?” She ignores your question. “Where am I? What is this place?”</p><p>You are at a loss for words.</p><p>“I was hoping you might have some answers, honestly.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she says, sounding genuine. “I don’t seem to remember.”</p><p>“How did you get down here? Did you swim?”</p><p>“Swim?”</p><p>You sigh, rubbing your temples. This is going nowhere, and ARC will be down here any minute. Undoubtedly they will plumb the pipes and determine you went another way. Any moment now you are expecting to hear the whine of Gauss weapons.</p><p>“Look,” you start. “I would love to have this conversation, but we both are about to have a problem.” An explosion, far nearer, goes off above. <strong>They must have found the crevice in the wall.</strong> You don’t have to explain what the sound signals, the other woman’s eyes are wide.</p><p>“Who are they?”</p><p>“No one you want to meet.” You take off the loose jacket tied around your waist, soggy as it may be, and offer it to her. “Especially not like that.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she says, donning the wet clothing. “Why are you here?”</p><p>“Again, questions I would love to answer, except,” you motion behind you. “You really don’t want to meet these guys.”</p><p>“Intruders, then?” Her eyes glimmer like rubies in the dim lighting. You suddenly realize she isn’t wearing a body suit, and the amount of skin revealed is quite disarming. <strong>She’s beautiful.</strong> it occurs to you.</p><p>“Yes, here to storm your fortress, princess.” You give her a toothy smile. &ldquo;But enough, I will explain as much as you want to hear if you can get us out of here.”</p><p>The woman thinks for a moment, then swings her legs into the pool of Synstal. You hiss, knowing how corrosive the substance is raw. “Careful!” You nearly shout, remembering to keep your voice low.</p><p>She gives you a puzzled glance and continues to wade through the metal. You can’t believe your eyes, where you expected horrific burns, her skin is unmarked as she rises out of the liquid. It cascades off her body, she stands in your jacket. Her tattoos, or at least you suppose that’s what you should call them, shift again to the red you had seen when you first entered.</p><p><strong>Who have I found?</strong> The question crosses your mind, just as you hear a Gauss rifle whine.</p><p>“Get down!” You shout, no point in hiding now. You duck to the floor, just as a torrent of bullets rip through the hallway. Grabbing the other sidearm strapped to your chest, you squeeze off a few rounds in return. For your efforts, you hear two heavy bodies hit the floor, bone and metal crunching together under the weight of the mechmen. Fearing the worst, you glance back at the woman, hoping she had heard you in time. You freeze.</p><p>She is standing here, still. Eyes glowing like two small stars. Her hair is floating around her in the still air, and her fingertips are tipped with red wires that trail along the floor.</p><p><strong>Oh Sol what have I done?</strong></p><p>Raising a hand, Synstal coils around her like a great serpent. The Gauss slag is caught, held as though by an invisible current. You can see each bullet glow red, and then ignite in a flash of heat. There is an explosion, and before you can blink, you are thrown back against the wall. The stone cracks, your head bounces off the jagged edge and you see stars. Your eyes feel cloudy, and your mouth is dry. For a moment, the world spins. You blur into blackness but manage to keep from passing out. <strong>Tick tick tick</strong> your radiation sensors start going ballistic. <strong>Tick tick tick tick</strong> they are filling with static now, overloaded by the burst of noise by the rem. The synstal hisses, bubbling and burning exposed wiring as the red energy crackles among the channels in the hall. <strong>What have I done,</strong> you wonder. Feeling again your own wires pulse from the ambient energy in the room</p><p>“Fall back!” Your hacked short band radio picks up the barely audible signal coming from a nearby fallen ARC goon. “Regroup! Intel didn’t report a Power user down here.” You hear the chatter, indistinct over the ringing in your ears from gunfire in such an enclosed space. <strong>Power?</strong> But you had never seen anything like this, nothing like the amber-red light that flooded the room like a midday sun. The powers you had seen were purple and green, you had even heard rumors of a terrible blue one too. But not red…</p><p>“Cerin?” The voice was too delicate for ARC. It took a moment to register that it was the woman. <strong>How does she know my name? Was it her calling for me? But how does she know that and not where she is?</strong> You have no answers, but remember to call back.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“How did you know my name?” She asks.</p><p><strong>She must be toying with me. I can’t be that lucky.</strong> But even as you thought this, her aura fades. Almost as quickly as it flared, the redness was replaced with a gentle amber glow. Her face is resolved to a blank stare, indecipherable in the dim</p><p><strong>What</strong>. “What do you mean? How did you know <strong>my</strong> name?”</p><p>“You said Ves, didn’t you? I think that’s my name,” she says, not answering the more pressing of the two questions.</p><p>“I said… oh, it was a guess.”</p><p>“Well done, are you ok?”</p><p>“As far as I can tell, are <strong>you</strong> ok?”</p><p>She checks herself once or twice over. “I think so. Should I be concerned?”</p><p><strong>That light. I’ve never heard of anything like it</strong> “I think I’m more concerned than you should be.” You glance at a monitor growing from your left wrist. <strong>At least the radiation is dissipating,</strong> you think with a hint of relief. “They’re gone,” <strong>for now.</strong></p><p>“Who was that?”</p><p>“Look, let’s get out of here first,” you look back up the stair, <strong>you probably don’t have long.</strong> “You have to know a way out, right?”</p><p>She slowly shakes her head, her brow furrowed. “Not from down here, but, I think there is a way from up there,” she points towards the stairs.</p><p>“That’s not the answer I was looking for.”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>You sigh, a headache forming. “We’re trapped, then.”</p><p>“Why can’t we go up there?” She points again.</p><p>“You saw those men? There are more. More and bigger, neither of what we need right now.”</p><p>“I–”</p><p>“Are you sure there isn’t another way out?”</p><p>“Cerin, I can get us out of here. I do know a way, we just have to get out of this tomb.” She steps forward, her skin rippling gold. You notice then that her skin has a luster not unlike the bottle in your bag. Before your eyes, a suit of golden armor is fabricated and attached like an exoskeleton over her. “Let’s go.”</p><p>You stand, your movement slow. <strong>That suit, is that synstal?</strong> You open your mouth to speak, but it seems superfluous. Despite the amount of metal, she was probably wearing, which should weigh her down considerably, she moves gracefully towards you and offers you a hand to climb the stairs. You brush the hand aside, placing a hand on the wall to steady yourself. Closer now, you get a better look at the armor. It looks nothing like the plate armor you have seen before, but there is a thought, nagging in the back of your mind. What is it they said about amber light?</p><p>“Where is this light coming from?”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“The red light, is there a source? You’re not carrying anything on you that looks like it would do that, and I sure as hell don’t have anything like it. So where is it coming from?”</p><p>At that, she chuckles. It’s bright, almost warm. It draws a look of confusion from you. She laughs to herself, running her fingers across the golden carapace she now wears. When she speaks, her smile is bright enough to warm the cold room.</p><p>“Cerin, this is my light. I thought you knew that.”</p><p><strong>She isn’t human.</strong> You think to yourself. As soon as the thought leaves your mind, a bolt of energy blasts through the cramped entranceway, sheathing into the wall next to you with enough force that the rock doesn&rsquo;t just fracture, but vaporizes entirely. Dusty air fills your nostrils. You hit the floor. The hallway shakes where the bullet had impacted it. Your ears are ringing again, as you search for the source of the shot you are met instead by a pair of armored boots. Before you have time to react, you see a face helmet down with a plasma cutter raised and charging up.</p><p>The ARC trooper is preparing to cut you in two at the middle.</p><p>You roll, narrowly escaping the beam as it punches through the floor where you had been, but you can feel the heat kiss your neck.</p><p>“There you are,” the ARC goon’s voice crackles over the speaker. He is ready, but so is Ves. This time, the red light wraps around his body first in tendrils, then it smothers his grunt. His body glows, then explodes. Jagged pieces of his armor rock with you, this time you feel something bite into your forearm. You scream, blood seeping out of a fresh gash.</p><p>“Sorry.” She says again.</p><p>You scramble to your feet, grappling with the wound that sliced through the skin, tendons. “Sol damn it why would you do <strong>that?</strong>”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I thought that would help and before I could stop–”</p><p>“I’m bleeding, you almost killed me, of course I’m fucking mad, stop apologizing. Please.” Your ferocity seems to break her. She shrinks away from you, walking a step or two back into the wall. You watch, stricken, as she falls to the ground, golden tears forming and dripping down her cheeks.</p><p>A moment passes in silence. Then you move to help her up.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” you whisper. “You terrified me, caught me off guard. But I shouldn’t have shouted at you.” Your arm is numb, but you should be able to move your fingers well enough to take care of that gash.</p><p>“No, I hurt you when I planned to help. You have every right to be angry.”</p><p>“It’s fine. Look, we have to keep moving, understand? Until we are well clear of here, we have to keep moving.” She nods as you start to tie a bandage on your arm. The wound is shallow, and the armor prevented any serious injury to the mid-forearm. It all happens in a haze, adrenaline pumping through your body and clouding your reactions. All you can think about right now is that Ves is a wildcard, and she can help you.</p><p>Another explosion rips through the cavern. <strong>They are digging their way through the stone,</strong> you realize with a jolt. “We have to go.”</p><p>Ves sprints by. You shout, but she ignores you.</p><p><em><strong>Clack Clack</strong></em>, the slide on your rifle seems fine–no dust. Quickly, you scramble after Ves. The air is growing warmer, and you can feel sweat forming on your brow. It is pulsing, and you feel the small of your back grow cold. <strong>Who are you?</strong> More explosions, or maybe just more feeling the detonations vibrate through the bedrock, and up into your legs. You decide you would rather not worry about the details too intensely. On the bright side, between being shot and the effects of the explosion, you seemed to have forgotten about nausea. Then it happens. You see a red light flash, and you cover your eyes. Through your hand, you see every bone, every finger. Gasping, the light is gone and you are left stunned. You rub around your eyes, willing sight back as the ocular sensors readjust to nearly burning out. <strong>Ves</strong>, what had happened? Quickly, you sprint up the stairs. </p><p>Above, carefully, you creep with the rifle held ready. You sweep the room as it comes into view, watching each pillar, each shadow. There is no one there. </p><p>“Ves?”</p><p>“Here,” A small voice to your right. She is laying there, slumped against a pillar. “I just woke up, still need to work on that endurance.” She giggles. </p><p>“What did you do?”</p><p>“I found us a way out.” She points, and you see a passage near the ceiling at the far end of the great room. “Are there more coming?”</p><p>An explosion shakes the floor, in answer. To your left, a pillar begins to fall. You glance at Ves. “Can you move?”</p><p>“I might need a minute, but I’ll be ok.”</p><p>“Give me your arm, here,” you sling her arm over your neck. “We don’t have time to wait.”</p><p>Carefully, you stand, pulling her with you. She is surprisingly light, even with the armor–it almost leaves you off balance as you come up. Still, you begin walking as quickly as you can, careful over the cables and bits of stone and wrent metal laying about. </p><p><strong>We’re not trapped.</strong></p><p>You glance at the white-haired woman hanging off you, limping along. <strong>And I have many questions.</strong></p></article></div><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://kneecaps.org/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Extant using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://kneecaps.org/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/seraphim_extant>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/7368697661>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
