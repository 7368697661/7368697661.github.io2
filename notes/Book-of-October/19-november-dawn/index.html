ASPIRATION, THOS, PRYLIS, OBSERVER, HOPE, LOGIC, ANIATIO, HEART, GNODENTA, ABSTRACTION, DÝNAMI, PARAMIA</p></blockquote><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: How was homework, guys?</p><p><em>People respond that it was rough, being vulnerable, but overall worth the effort.</em></p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Isn&rsquo;t that cool, when we let our walls down, people take theirs down. It&rsquo;s interesting to take this concept of children playing a game and expand it. So lets assume all Americans, for the moment, are 5 years old. And we play a &ldquo;game&rdquo; (and I certainly don&rsquo;t believe it isn&rsquo;t serious) called &ldquo;Pandemic&rdquo;.</p><p>How do the 5 year olds react? Some yell, some hide, some pretend to be invincible. Take for example a man making a scene in a grocery store because he has to wear a mask, it&rsquo;s because it challenges his coping make believe. That he is big and strong and very powerful and nothing can hurt him. We think this is very silly and dangerous, because we are playing the role of &ldquo;cooperators&rdquo;. Now, I very much believe that masks are an essential tool for public health. But if you look at it as a game that scared people don&rsquo;t know how to get out of, it begins to make more sense.</p><p><strong>THOS</strong>: I had a 2 hour talk with my mom yesterday. She was surprised I opened up to her since she always asks me to and I never actually do.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: That&rsquo;s awesome, did she open up to you?</p><p><strong>THOS</strong>: She did actually. It was me opening up to her that acted as the catalyst. She had been just as scared as I was this entire time.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: That makes me really happy, I&rsquo;m glad you did that.</p><p>This chat is about how to stop playing the game. Now, I&rsquo;m going to take the day off to do absolutely nothing, there was a big blow up (again) with one of the mods. But I thought it would be useful for the Beat Poets to have a discussion about what the main theme of each talk was, and, if you get that far, how each one opens the next. I think it would be valuable for the Dharma Bums to see an over-aching view of the themes presented.</p><p><em>As it turned out, he didn’t take the day off.</em></p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: You&rsquo;ll find, hopefully, a new concept begin to form if you can distill each story and see how they are related.</p><p><strong>PRYLIS</strong>: Is this is where we&rsquo;re going to pick up next time?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Next time we&rsquo;re going to inspect self doubt. The whole story is about how to stop playing the game when you want to and just let yourself out.</p><p><em>The crew takes some time to reflect, review, and re-evaluate on what they have learned. Some come to share and seek advice on how they view themselves, some seek knowledge they can’t believe they might already know. Later, OBSERVER arrives, the form of presence Aspiration occasionally dons in the chats.</em></p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: There was a dream once.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It was mine.</p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: There was a dream, regardless.
Of a man who could not see the reflections of himself, in the mirror of other people.</p><p>They changed for him.</p><p>And they refused to stay fixed. Can you imagine the terror, of believing you are talking to you mother, or lover, or friend, and having them change? From one to the other, and then to others. It would split the ego. Who would you be, if there were no one to reflect you? No role to play, a son to a mother, a combatant to an enemy?</p><p>In the absence of these things, you would be just madness, instead of reflecting social roles, you would reflect the noise of the world. We require the faces of others, to tell us who we are. And we are simply the intersection of their views.</p><p>There is no here, here.</p><p>Like light being reflected and focused. Intersections of collapsing waves, and you wonder why you are so turbulent inside yourself.</p><p>You are the incompatibilities of vision inherent in other people. The output of their own reflection. A nexus of collapsing waves. You are your fathers disappointment, your mothers insecurities, your lovers quiet inadequacies, your bosses tempestuous frustration. These views intersect over a spot, and that intersection is brighter than the background, because that&rsquo;s were the focus is. And that brightness is what you call yourself.</p><p>You are a network. And a network of none is nonsense. A network of one, an antonym. If you are wondering what is underneath those reflections. Who you really are.</p><p>You might as well be asking what an intersection is in the absence of roads. You&rsquo;re all of it, or you&rsquo;re none of it. A point of awareness being tricked by the light.</p><p><strong>HOPE</strong>: This all reminds me of a quote from earlier: &ldquo;<em>The concept of a self is almost entirely the constructs of other minds reflected back at us. Who we think we are is a collection of the reflections of us in the people close to us.</em>&rdquo;</p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: Good god, I’m making charts and missing out. A few days ago I posted a question. “Does anyone else feel like they wear a different mask around different people?” That’s to say, do you change your personality depending on who’s around you? The answer was yes, all around. I am who I think people see. I’m seeing me through an idea I’ve imposed on them, of how they view me. I’m looking through them as a filter and reflecting what I believe the filter sees. Without those filters&mldr; what’s left?</p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: Nothing. Or everything.</p><p><strong>ANIATIO</strong>: If there were no one to reflect would you have no sense of self, no &ldquo;I&rdquo;? Is reflecting the noise of the world the same as being one with the pond? Would this alone bring presence?</p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: Presence is a default state.</p><p><strong>HEART</strong>: If everyone is a rainbow condensed into white light, where is the projection from?</p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: Judgment refracts it. It is an emergent phenomenon of what is. Consciousness is an emergent property of matter, scaling with complexity. Thank you for being here.</p><p><strong>GNODENTA</strong>: If perception of a vibration creates a sound, perception of oneself creates only oneself as perceived, but not in our truest sense? We only know ourselves in this processed state, post-perception by others.</p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: &ldquo;Knowing&rdquo; &ldquo;Ones self&rdquo; is oxymoronical. If you were yourself you could change.</p><p><strong>GNODENTA</strong>: &ldquo;If you were yourself you could change.&rdquo; Because a person is the sum of those perceptions, that person cannot intrinsically change?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: That person requires the belief that they can change to be reflected to them by someone else.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: So, we are the combined result of a network of overlapping data, at a certain point of this overlapping network there’s me, or you. The ripples collide, judgment is turbulent. I cannot change, without root source to the operating system the network runs on. Or I have no idea what I’m talking about</p><p><strong>OBSERVER</strong>: They key is this.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: If you were to realize that you were only a source of light. A nexus of those who knew you before. And know you now. If you knew that completely, then you would have an existential crisis. This is the definition of &ldquo;ego death&rdquo;,
because without that intersection, all that&rsquo;s left is everything. And so there is no &ldquo;you&rdquo;. What would it feel like to let go of you? All of you? It feels like death. Physically.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: Well I feel like I’m dying now.</p><p><strong>GNODENTA</strong>: Reading this hurts.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: That’s enough for me, goodnight.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Drink water, Logic, and look outside, it&rsquo;s a nice night. I&rsquo;m sorry if it hurts, it gets easier. And I have some comfort to offer. Identifying as a self is the most ingrained ripple there is. You&rsquo;ll snap back like a rubber band, you can&rsquo;t get lost.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: My heart rate is up, I’m nauseous. It feels like a near death experience; I’m out, going to reflect on this.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Come back if you need. And good luck. This is an excellent time to focus on grounding. As we stretch these concepts we&rsquo;re going to be dealing with powerful emotions. The antidote to them is to reverse course. If you feel overwhelmed, simply ground. Look at 5 things, and name them. Listen for 4 things, and name them. Touch three things, and name them. Smell two things, and name them. Taste on thing, and name it.</p><p><strong>HEART</strong>: So that voice in the back of your head then: that is the Jungian collective unconscious?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: That voice in the back of your head, what you consider &ldquo;your voice&rdquo; is your attachment figures from when you were young. You father and mother, siblings, relatives, friends and teachers; all combined with the strong relationships you have today. It is a discordant chorus, and if you weren&rsquo;t so wedded to this concept of &ldquo;self&rdquo; you would still hear their voices. This is the nature of the train station meditation.</p><p><strong>ANIATIO</strong>: I&rsquo;ve used grounding before, but having this context makes a lot more sense as to why it works.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, all fear is essential the fear of ego death. Grounding reminds it that it exists.</p><p><strong>ABSTRACTION</strong>: OK I feel a lot better now, touching and naming things helped almost immediately.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, Abstraction. That was the sensation of letting go. Feeling better was the sensation of holding on again. I&rsquo;ll keep showing you the exits, and keep showing you there is a handrail the whole way down. If we were in person, I would notice those starting to panic in the room and sit with them and push them deeper while leaning against them. In the absence of this in person comfort, I&rsquo;m trying to give you the coping skills to do this alone.</p><p>How are you, Abstraction?</p><p><strong>ABSTRACTION</strong>: I keep thinking about it and keep feeling sick. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m being dragged into it.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Absent any mental or emotional illnesses, it is perfectly safe to fall into it. You will come back. But it will be extraordinarily unpleasant.</p><p><strong>DÝNAMI</strong>: Was this because it was my ego trying not to let go?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: The message is deeply forgiving to ones self. That can be a relief, that can bring tears. It isn&rsquo;t an easy lesson, most people will reject this out of hand. Being willing to even look at it says volumes about the people who made you, you.</p><p><em>To note, a lot of people are also voicing that they do not feel anything currently, as these people seem to.</em></p><p><strong>PARAMIA</strong>: I don’t feel the dread.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: That’s fine, everyone has their own exits. I of course am dealing with the people feeling it now, because they need the focus.</p><p><strong>HOPE</strong>: I’m reading it and everything makes sense. It feels like a lot of concepts and things I’ve learned here and elsewhere are clicking; but yeah I’m not feeling the dread either.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: If your ego is still involved in grasping this, of mastering the words I&rsquo;m saying, of mastering understanding, and you aren&rsquo;t not instead doing it. You&rsquo;re simply going to reinforce your ego, which feels&mldr; like it always has. Understanding this will do nothing but breed another self assured rhino.</p><p><strong>HOPE</strong>: How do we do it.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Some people are taking the lecture course right now, some are taking the lab. Both are fine. One is not better. You have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and infinite time to get it.</p><p><strong>DÝNAMI</strong>: As soon as I touched my phone to keep reading I started to feel better and the grounding oneself helped me get back for sure almost instantly.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Your phone is custom built to give you a feeling of togetherness. It is inherent in it&rsquo;s design, it&rsquo;s no wonder it makes you feel better. The secret to life is simply to die before you die.</p><p><strong>Abstraction</strong>, how are you? You too, Logic.</p><p><strong>ABSTRACTION</strong>: I’m not sure, I keep staring at a remote control for my TV.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: That&rsquo;s perfect.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: I was happily making little charts for everyone, then uhh&mldr; that was unexpected.</p><p><strong>ABSTRACTION</strong>: It&rsquo;s so odd, when I look away I instantly feel something rising in my throat and back of my mouth.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, the idea has got you good. Do you want to take a break from it or keep looking at it? I wish I could tell you folks the number of times a week I spend covered in sweat certain I&rsquo;m dying. Then I don&rsquo;t and I call my girlfriend. Or play with my daughter.</p><p><strong>DÝNAMI</strong>: Yes! I forgot about that. I felt tingles throughout my entire body first, what was it?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s common. The tingling scares the hell out of me. Usually in my hands, feet and face.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: I feel a combination of 3 things1. I was almost crushed by an out of control semi on ice 2. When I heard someone explain the size of the universe in a way I could almost comprehend 3. When a family member died. It was all of those. And yes, tingles starting in my chest and flowing outward</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: In other words, other times you were faced with incontrovertible truth.</p><p><strong>DÝNAMI</strong>: It felt like almost like when you take pre-workout and you get that itchy tingly feeling . I had it start in my legs and almost violently move throughout my entire body.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I&rsquo;m sorry, I know that&rsquo;s scary. Alright! Enough! Get up! Jump around, go get some water! Open a window and look outside! Stop listening to a crazy man on the internet! We&rsquo;ll come back, it&rsquo;ll be here.</p><p>End story time.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/notes/Book-of-October/0-the-book-of-october/ data-ctx="notes/Book of October/19-november-dawn" data-src=/notes/Book-of-October/0-the-book-of-october class=internal-link>The Book of October</a></li><li><a href=/notes/Book-of-October/18-they-know-not-what-they-do/ data-ctx="notes/Book of October/19-november-dawn" data-src=/notes/Book-of-October/18-they-know-not-what-they-do class=internal-link>They Know Not what they Do</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://kneecaps.org/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Extant using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://kneecaps.org/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/seraphim_extant>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/7368697661>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
