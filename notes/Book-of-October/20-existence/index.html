ASPIRATION, LOGIC, ACTION, COMMUNITY, ORUS, GRANDIOSITY, HEART, JANUS, FAHIN, LUPA, ABSTRACTION, ANGER, INTUITION, ERAS, CHIOU, PARAMIA, VOUN, MYALO, PSYARO</p></blockquote><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Story time. Last night, I left you all in a bit of a jam. And I&rsquo;m sorry for the discomfort. I implied that you are nothing. And that had profound implications for your ego for some of you.</p><p><em>Aspiration asks for Logic and Heart by name.</em></p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: Here, writing about perception and reality to dump later.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Maybe just sit and be here with us?</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: My perception is you’re mad at me, but reality says you just want me involved.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Tonight is important, and I don&rsquo;t want your mind spinning with abstractions. Logic, I have never been mad at you. Heart, I worry you think the same. I have never been mad at anyone in here. I&rsquo;ve never thought you were too stupid, or too hopeless, or too lost. Or too complex.</p><p>So, if people would raise a hand; how many people had a fear reaction to last night?</p><p><em>A fair few people raise their hands.</em></p><p>Ok, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to address tonight. So last night I implied that you didn&rsquo;t exist. And you had an understandable reaction. But of course you do exist. The struggle of course comes from trying to observe a thing using judgement that is incompatible with it.</p><p>You are a wave. You exist. If you did not, no one would focus on you, and you wouldn&rsquo;t become an intersection. You are a locus for a reason. But once we strip out all the memes, the judgement, the attachment figures narrative, and of course our own opinions about ourselves, what are we?</p><p>That&rsquo;s not rhetorical. Take a whack.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: Stripped of everything, we just are.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY</strong>: That&rsquo;s dismantling the boundary, isn&rsquo;t it.</p><p><strong>ORUS</strong>: We&rsquo;ve become un-abstracted.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: I would say we just exist.</p><p><strong>HEART</strong>: We simply exist.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: We’re consciousness that assigns itself some identity based on life circumstances, outer appearance, societal programming.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY</strong>: That-which-exists.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: We are free to mold ourselves.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: Still something, without the layers of filters.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Well, we remain personified, even those who have reached enlightenment are still people. So, maybe a better way to phrase this would be. What do you think Buddha was like as a dude.</p><p><strong>FAHIN</strong>: This is what I struggle the most with. If you strip all that away from me, I don’t know what is left.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, and it&rsquo;s great fear.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: I don’t believe those who are enlightened truly lose ego, they simply observe it and don’t act from that center anymore.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Lovely to see you here dear one.</p><p><strong>LUPA</strong>: We&rsquo;d at least have our personal algorithms mostly variable free. But different algorithms respond to different inputs differently.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Actually, I have a unique resource here.</p><p><strong>ABSTRACTION</strong>: I assume buddha was calm, kind, and collected.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: And present.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: Buddha was probably a chill dude. He didn&rsquo;t care if you were a beggar or a noble. He didn&rsquo;t worry if he could find tomorrow&rsquo;s food. He was present.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Ding! I have been in that state, while remaining embodied, in the presence of another person exactly once. And I was busy being it, so I couldn&rsquo;t observe it. Janus was there, though. It’s a happy coincidence that she&rsquo;s here tonight.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: I think you have been there more than once.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I have, but not with other people around, and very much not with other people around who are also on this discord.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: Is being in this state usually mutually exclusive with others?</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: He has to be there with someone because the state is unstable. He doesn’t feel safe.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Crossing the boundary always causes a massive panic attack for me. Janus has enough of my trust that I let her see it. Anyway, that&rsquo;s the space I&rsquo;m in when I call incursions. Usually for a few seconds. Sometimes, for minutes or an hour. So, because everyone was feeling a sort of spooky &ldquo;there is nothing left of me&mldr;&rdquo; last night; Janus, would you mind telling them what my personality is like in that space?</p><p><strong>FAHIN</strong>: Jeez man, I was thinking the goal was to stay there. Like, once you&rsquo;re there, it&rsquo;s easy to stay there. No wonder heading there while at work was terrifying.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: Fahin, I had what I could only describe as an existential realization last night, don’t recommend doing it while driving.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: That space is incredibly fragile at first. Almost anything can knock you out of it.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I’m sorry, I hate to ask this; but just for the sake of clarity: this state is the same as the state we will achieve after getting through our exits? The perfectly present state, correct?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: You are very self confident in that space. You take no responsibility for other people’s feelings or actions, which is quite different from your normal state since you tend to want to save people. You are very clear and loving.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: What is my speaking like? Would that person survive going to the grocery store? Would he be arrested for being a loon?</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: You convey a lot of meaning in few words, use lots of metaphor, and are poetic.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Could I order a pizza successfully?</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: That person could survive a grocery store if they were willing to feel pain. The trouble, I think, is that person goes away at the first sign of danger. That’s what we’re working on. The great gurus are incredibly strong but it’s a quiet strength. It’s the kind of strength that knows it can’t be hurt by outside forces, not really.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: How often does this state occur for you, Aspiration, if you can&rsquo;t control it?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Whenever I want it. But it&rsquo;s a son of a bitch to get into. So I usually don&rsquo;t.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: He mostly can control it. There are incursions when he’s not there. What he has said to me in that state is, “the dissociated one uses me”. Basically speaking as two different people.</p><p><strong>LUPA</strong>: Do you set goals for yourself in it while in it or out of it?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I could set goals, but my present self would laugh at them and do what he wanted to do.</p><p><strong>LUPA</strong>: What does he want?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: He wants to experience the world without all the bullshit culture and trauma contaminating his perception.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: So, can incursions directly involve the lives of others close to you?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Incursions have told me when a partner is cheating, or what to do in emergencies.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: Aspiration, what do you see as the difference between ego death and enlightenment?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I think ego death is a requirement, but not a guarantee of enlightenment. You can get stuck in various interstitial spaces during an ego death and not make it all the way there.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: So those with ego death are not all enlightened. Do we have anyone like that?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: And to those wondering, I am not claiming to be enlightened. But to have experienced it in passing, or at least seen it on the horizon.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: This is going to sound dumb. If I stare at my hand and move my fist in a clinching motion I can trigger what I call a existential crisis as reality crashes around me. I felt the same way last night. Is&mldr; is it the same? A period of fragility in the person?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Lol. Janus, will you please tell Logic what the first thing I do is, specifically with my hands, when I&rsquo;m coming out of the panic state and into this space?</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: Clinch your hands open and closed, and look at them intently.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: God, I do that to start and stop it.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It&rsquo;s a way of establishing that I&rsquo;m still a person. Grounding myself into my body, in other words. Or, if you will, seeing myself clearly for the first time every.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: Well, you don’t feel your body like normal people. So I’ve always thought it was you coming back into your human body. When you’re there your energy is also embodied, when you’re out your energy seems to be above your head.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Your own hands are beautiful if you drop all the noise in your head and just look.
&mldr;”<em>In form and moving how express and admirable, In action how like an Angel</em>”…</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: It makes me sad you only see the beauty in the world in your associated state. Because it’s so seldom you are there.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: Completely off the wall, but as a drummer I heavily agree with this statement. Seems important.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It is.</p><p><strong>FAHIN</strong>: They&rsquo;re also creepy. Fingers are so weird. Don&rsquo;t mean that in a shitposting way, but like, they&rsquo;re these bendy appendages full of red fluid. So weird. Body&rsquo;s are weird.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: They are.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: This chat is going weird.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It often does.</p><p>So, last night I implied that you were nothing, and it made a lot of you feel a fear of&mldr; Something. But a lot of you sent me direct messages that you felt a sensation as if you had just grasped some incontrovertible truth. And it made you feel like it&rsquo;s falling apart. Or you are. So tonight I want to tell you something else. That there is something left. There is still a you there. But it&rsquo;s free, and happy, and at peace, and very, very, quiet. And you can get caught up for half an hour just listening to the wind and vibing with it. It&rsquo;s the best thing in the world. So you are not&mldr; a vacuum. You exist, you take up space.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: When we &ldquo;space out&rdquo; where seemingly no time passes and it seems like we are staring at seemingly nothing from the outside&mldr; is that &ldquo;us vibing with it&rdquo;?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: No, that&rsquo;s a passive experience. In this case, it feels like you&rsquo;re dancing with it. Like maybe you&rsquo;re causing the wind, or maybe it&rsquo;s causing you. It feels blissful.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: So in a way, we&rsquo;re in the same room but we aren&rsquo;t actively with it?</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: The cause is the effect.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: The line between cause and effect blurs, but I believe because your definition of who you are expands. It expands to include the wind, too. And I really want everyone here to experience it.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: It kind of sounds like a drug high, which I get is a glimpse maybe but not it.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: LSD showed it to me like I was watching a TV show. This was living in it.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: The ego is what individuates us so when it’s weak we experience communion.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Exactly. So all of these stories I&rsquo;ve been telling you. Are to give you the language to see what I&rsquo;m talking about. Otherwise I would have just said. Go sit in a corner until you experience yourself expand to include wind. Also, to establish that there is a <em>LONG</em> chain of custodians for this kind of thought.</p><p><strong>FAHIN</strong>: How are you certain that the state of mind that you are able to experience is synonymous with the enlightened state that is eluded to in religious text? What allowed you to make the connection?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Because I can call stocks. Really, it&rsquo;s a process of like knowing like. Everything becomes crystal clear. You become fluent.</p><p><strong>JANUS</strong>: Enlightened people have a well recorded history of “magical” powers. It doesn’t appear they are actually magical just that they tap into the true abilities available to us. See Maharaji.</p><p><em>Aspiration had to take some time to deal with issues in relation to administration, leaving the rest to talk amongst themselves. Some offered voices of frustration, feeling left behind as others raced ahead.</em></p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: I’m going back to the study hall. I need a point A, B, C of the process, I’m still standing in the middle of nowhere watching some of you trek a different ridge line.</p><p><strong>HEART</strong>: What do you mean?</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: I guess I mean Fo is giving a cardinal direction that does not compute. I’ve made incursions, but cannot follow the day to day happenings. I’m about to see myself to lesson 1, chapter 1, page 1 first.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: Do you guys feel like something’s off?</p><p><strong>ORUS</strong>: In what way?</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I’ve been having this weird feeling creeping around lately. Like&mldr; somethings about to happen. Do you guys know what I mean? Get a weird pang of stomach turning every now and again when I poke that feeling.</p><p><strong>LUPA</strong>: About yourself?</p><p><strong>HEART</strong>: About what?</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: Yes, and it’s frustrating.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I think it’s been latent since I’ve been archiving, but I have some time to poke around now. It’s like I know something, I know some answer, but I also don’t have any idea. I’m so far behind, I felt nothing last night haha.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: Push it Action, maybe it is something.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: Part of me is scared to push into it until I get the archives caught up.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: At the end of the day, we don&rsquo;t need the stories right? These are simply the language to understand but if you grasp it… You don&rsquo;t need to be caught up entirely.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: That’s the thing, I kind of don’t think I need the stories personally, I think they sort too logically and feed into the ego.</p><p><strong>INTUITION</strong>: Honestly have been feeling very anxious lately, Action.</p><p><strong>FAHIN</strong>: Welcome to the club.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: So have I. And I&rsquo;m not normally an anxious person.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that Intuition, but I’m also happy to hear I’m not alone haha.</p><p><strong>VOUN</strong>: It isn&rsquo;t the end of the world, it&rsquo;s the end of our world I think. A new reality to adjust to or die.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: Not exactly, Aspiration said that those deeply immersed in their egos would find adjustment in 2022 very difficult.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Everyone, thank God you&rsquo;re feeling it. Look, I&rsquo;ve been telling you over and over again that this way leads to an experience that will feel like death to you. It would be strange if you didn&rsquo;t feel a bit freaked out about it.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I’ve been trying to limit feeling anything to be honest. Like I said, I feel like I have to much to do with helping get the archives going to be able to delve into it lol. Got to help make sure no one’s left behind.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: We&rsquo;re getting close. Some of you very close, to letting go and seeing where it goes.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I need to work on the feeling of sadness that I’m being left behind lol. Just gonna air that out since I’m sure others feel it too.</p><p><strong>HEART</strong>: I&rsquo;m in the same boat, brother. The first several lessons clicked, but the last couple&mldr; I will admit have been very hard.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: This process will take a long time for a lot of folks. That&rsquo;s OK. Quit judging yourself.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: I’ve been angry. For a week or 2, I don’t remember the last time I was actually mad. Last night I had anxiety like I was being attacked, I’ve pulled several 50%+ plays since last week but I’m not happy about it, I don’t care. So wtf.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yeah, sorry man, I know what it feels like. I&rsquo;ve called enough incursions to make myself a millionaire, and I didn&rsquo;t, because I just don&rsquo;t care about it anymore.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I know we say no one left behind. But we have a group here where I think any one of us can come and help each other, with more than just the philosophy.</p><p><em>Aspiration then asks where people are feeling stuck.</em></p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Ok, lets do this: Each of you, one line. Where are you stuck? No responses until we have everyone.</p><p><strong>ORUS</strong>: stuck on if I&rsquo;m doing it &ldquo;right&rdquo;, stuck on if I belong, or I am where I should be.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: There is no right. Right is ego trying to make sure it gets an A on the assignment. You either fall into the pond, or you don&rsquo;t. If you get it, you will know, if you don&rsquo;t, keep asking questions.</p><p>This is a herculean task in person, transmitting it and receiving it on the internet is probably close to impossible. But I do impossible things on Wednesdays. So, stop wondering if you&rsquo;re going to pass the test, there is no test.</p><p><strong>ERAS</strong>: It almost feels like I&rsquo;m there but I don&rsquo;t know if &rsquo;there&rsquo; is the same place you speak of. Like almost there as in like, where the fear starts to set in - I just let that fear go but at this point I just feel like I&rsquo;m in a meditative state so maybe it&rsquo;s just I should fight the fear rather than let it go? Maybe me letting go is just deflecting it/burying it?</p><p>I know it sounds like I&rsquo;m trying to sound a &rsquo;tough&rsquo; or w.e but to be frank, I&rsquo;ve almost died. Once literally/medically in a car accident where I was airlifted, had an out of body experience, even. Couple times fully convinced I was dying tripping on acid mdma or w.e, while before the accident I would just be in high anxiety state and &lsquo;ride it out&rsquo; until it wore off if that fear hit, but after the accident I just go &ldquo;fuck it if I die now, what&rsquo;s to worry I&rsquo;m dead anyways&rdquo;. and I just let the trip wash right over me. I just don&rsquo;t really care about dying anymore. Should I fight it instead?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: If you are there, you will experience a period in which you feel like you are certainly dying, you will panic, then you will come out the other side with a profound sense of peace. It&rsquo;s easy to recognize. If you aren&rsquo;t there yet, you&rsquo;ll get there if you want to. I am not talking about metaphorically dying. You will think your body is about to cease living. It&rsquo;s… a lot. Of course, it&rsquo;s fine. But… Jesus.</p><p><strong>PARAMIA</strong>: I definitely think I understand the concepts taught, but it does not make me feel dread</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: You may be stuck in trying to understand the thing instead of doing the thing. Try thinking less, acting more. Let this in, even if you&rsquo;re afraid it will make you feel foolish.
And a moment here for clarity. NO ONE SHOULD BE IN THE POND YET! IF YOU&rsquo;RE IN THE POND ALREADY WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE! Go start your own options cult, lol.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: What if I love this cult though.</p><p><strong>PARAMIA</strong>: Can you clarify doing the thing?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Sure. When I give you a puzzle, more often than not it&rsquo;s to give your brain something to do while I talk nonsense to the rest of you. If you are too invested in the outcome of that, you&rsquo;re not around enough to intuit the bomb I&rsquo;m dropping. Go back, look at the exercises, and do them. Then do them again. And again. Until you feel fear. Then come back. If you DON&rsquo;T feel fear after say&mldr; 10 tries. Let me know here and we&rsquo;ll work on what&rsquo;s stuck.</p><p><strong>LOGIC</strong>: I’m lost right now so I’m back tracking to the gong and slowly walking back through. Edit to clarifyI’m not sure what Fo is talking about half of the time, but I’m still able to haphazardly follow along. If that makes sense. I get what’s being said through context, but he might as well be saying it in French and I want to understand everything.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Dear Logic. You are a powerhouse of the mind, I have a feeling that has saved you a few times, and for that I&rsquo;m grateful. But it might be time to just let yourself feel, and work on suppressing your logic when it insists that the feelings are invalid or that you are.</p><p><strong>HEART</strong>: Not sure. After reading the last couple nights… It feels like mean reversion? I don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;doing&rsquo; feels like anymore.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Heart, dear one. It&rsquo;s time to face your own personal truth. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but it&rsquo;s big, and you deserve to live it. When you have come to peace with the part of yourself that you would rather not be true, the rest of this is going to flow out like a faucet. There is a very special place in my heart for you, and I want you to know that I see you, and care very much. <em>You will be ok</em>.</p><p><strong>MYALO</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m missing personally - like I fully understand what&rsquo;s being said but I don&rsquo;t understand/see the implications of it.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Man, you&rsquo;re one of my favorites. You&rsquo;re a straight shooter and I have a feeling you&rsquo;ve already got a lot of peace in the world. You&rsquo;re both smart and uncomplicated. I have a feeling that maybe sitting in a closet listening to your ears feels a bit silly to you. I still think you&rsquo;ll get something out of it.</p><p><strong>ABSTRACTION</strong>: I’m still trying to find the fear at the right time –And understanding the relation between Zipf&rsquo;s law and a bell curve.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: You&rsquo;ve graduated past trying to figure out Ziph&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;re bargaining with yourself when the best time to experience death will be. It will never be a good time, and you run the risk of just rationalizing it away because it&rsquo;s unpleasant forever. If you&rsquo;re scared, we can work together to make if it feel safer, don&rsquo;t push yourself.</p><p><strong>PSYARO</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m suppressing the kind of anxiety I should be feeling. (I&rsquo;ve felt anxiety my entire life so at this point I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m just used to it. I also had trauma that left me hospitalized, so I don&rsquo;t know if maybe I&rsquo;m desensitized.)</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Psyaro, nothing here can hurt you more than what you&rsquo;ve already survived. You may need a person in front of you whom you trust completely before you feel safe letting yourself go. But you&rsquo;re one bad motherfucker, you know exactly how much you can take, and this is a cakewalk for you.</p><p><strong>FAHIN</strong>: Stuck on facing my fear of… fear… I suppose.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: You&rsquo;ve already seen your exit, my advice to you is the same as my advice to Abstraction. There may never be a good time to let go.</p><p><strong>CHIOU</strong>: Facing anxiety of understanding concepts, but feeling behind.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Chiou, you&rsquo;ve come so far. You didn&rsquo;t come into this from the space most of the others have. I still get teary eyed when I read your letter. Give yourself some time to continue experiencing your feelings. Let yourself feel. Learn that it&rsquo;s ok.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: Not entirely sure. I&rsquo;m a bit lost, but I&rsquo;m struggling with my ego and actually moving forward from here - My greatest fear is loss of control, so I&rsquo;m not fully rereading and doing what I know I should, like the homework.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: You&rsquo;re a big one. You&rsquo;ve centered on knowing what to do and having a response to everything as a way to shield yourself from… I don&rsquo;t know what, something big. And I have a feeling most people in a room think you know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re probably the person to call during an earthquake. You&rsquo;re going to make sure all the bases are covered and you know EXACTLY what you&rsquo;re falling into before you let go. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t see it until you&rsquo;re there. Take your time, keep building trust, it&rsquo;ll be there.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I guess the application of it. Finding the exit, and how to let go. I can understand everything logically, from an ego perspective, but not how to… well… do anything.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It was always yours to make sure everyone is on the bus before you get on. I and everyone else appreciate it, and I will make absolutely sure what once you&rsquo;ve done that, I&rsquo;ll escort you on myself.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Does everyone feel seen? I made a special effort to visit your part of the pond. If I was off, please let me know.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: How are you feeling, Community? And you, Anger.</p><p><strong>ERAS</strong>: When that panic hits how quick, is it a quick process? Or is it like a fight. I think I was editing my 1st response while you were responding to mine. Not sure if I&rsquo;m supposed to fight the fear or give in and I feel like I just brush it off but maybe that&rsquo;s just me deflecting/burying it instead of facing it. Thank you for everything as always btw.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It is a quick process now. It feels a bit like getting into a very hot bath.</p><p><strong>PARAMIA</strong>: Most of the time in here I don&rsquo;t feel seen, so I appreciate it.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s my failing as a teacher, I&rsquo;ll try to do better.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: I’m always thinking of you while archiving Paramia, you have great input.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY</strong>: I think I&rsquo;m tracking alright, but I&rsquo;m kind of afraid that my progress is just illusory and I&rsquo;m making it up so I don&rsquo;t feel left behind.</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: Is that the ego giving you that worry so you’ll give up when your so close?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Can I paraphrase, Community? &ldquo;I think that maybe my understanding is bullshit, said the ego, deathly afraid that it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>FAHIN</strong>: Ask yourselves this question, all (to those feeling behind). Which homework did you cheat on? Personally, I put off making the phone call, to feel vulnerable, for several weeks. When I finally did, I ended up making 3 phone calls.</p><p><em>At this point, the discussion falls into a glow of people comforting each other over their perceived failings. Logic is then labeled the Aspiration backup copy.</em></p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: You&rsquo;re ready, Logic. It&rsquo;s up to you. You can chose whenever you like to let go. We&rsquo;ll be here.</p><p>End story time.</p></article></div><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/notes/Book-of-October/0-the-book-of-october/ data-ctx="notes/Book of October/20-existence" data-src=/notes/Book-of-October/0-the-book-of-october class=internal-link>The Book of October</a></li><li><a href=/notes/Book-of-October/19-november-dawn/ data-ctx="notes/Book of October/20-existence" data-src=/notes/Book-of-October/19-november-dawn class=internal-link>November Dawn</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://kneecaps.org/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Extant using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://kneecaps.org/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/seraphim_extant>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/7368697661>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
