ASPIRATION, ANGER, GNODENTA, COMMUNITY, INTROSPECTION, THALIAN, ACTION, BORACLIES, THOS, GRANDIOSITY, BERO, ANIATIO, PARAMIA, ORAMIO</p></blockquote><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It&rsquo;s¬†<em>Story time</em>. Today we&rsquo;re going to talk about 3 things: Ritual, Tokenization, and The Lords Prayer. So, we&rsquo;ve established in the past that ancient religion is a an astrological allegory, hybridized with a number of concepts, or nam-shubs that established standards for society, health, and psychological care. But one thing we haven&rsquo;t talked about is the dogma that surrounds these. The standards, the rituals. Why is dogma and ritual a desirable trait? That question isn&rsquo;t rhetorical.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: It‚Äôs a helpful vessel for encoding, socially?</p><p><strong>GNODENTA</strong>: Consistency?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Both correct, but there is a deeper individual reason.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY</strong>: Grounding and connection to all the others who do/have used the same?</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Dogma can be desirable if the principles are virtuous.</p><p><strong>THALIAN</strong>: It reinforces belief.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: You&rsquo;re all on the right wavelength, we&rsquo;re interested in this case with the underlying principle in here, like always, so lets explore that. When a person quits smoking, they are most successful if they set a day, remove all the paraphernalia, and tell others of their plans. One of the most successful treatments for alcoholics is a group setting that reinforces certain ritualized behaviors as well.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: Accountability, in that case; both personal and social.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Accountability is certainly half of this. What&rsquo;s the other half?</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: Commitment?</p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: Motivation.</p><p><strong>BORACLIES</strong>: Validation?</p><p><strong>THOS</strong>: Discipline, willpower.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY</strong>: Support.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Those things are all involved. But importantly, and something our modern society is quickly losing‚Ä¶ is ritualization. Compounding social and personal choices with an aspect of holiness. Baptism, for instance, in the classic sense utilized otherwise meaningless ritualized movements in a social setting to impart holiness. Dunking yourself underwater is not meaningful. Tokenizing that act, with supporting dogma and ritual reinforces a decision made on the part of the individual being baptized. Psychologically you are aligning and inviting all aspects of yourself to reinforce a decision.</p><p><strong>BERO</strong>: It‚Äôs a consecrating act.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes. Remember how we&rsquo;ve talked about the breakdown of the bicameral mind? That process is by no means complete. While ancient humans may well have had a voice in their head representing the superego, we still have aspects of ourselves that are occluded from our consciousness. Are folks following?</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: Yes. One thing, though. I‚Äôve heard studies show you have a greater chance of being successful with your goals if you tell fewer people about them.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, there is an optimal number.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: Telling someone about a project has the same dopamine response as finishing it.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: But you are almost completely unlikely to accomplish a difficult goal if you tell no one about it. We aren&rsquo;t talking about work projects, we are talking about undertaking a change that will involve new aspects of ourselves. So, if we can agree that we have parts of ourselves operating independently of our surface level desires. And we see evidence of this in our daily lives everywhere. Then you can understand the importance of ritualization. It gets multiple aspects of yourself to align on a decision. So, for instance, if I decide to quit gambling and whoring and become a godly, productive member of society because that is what my conscious self wants‚Ä¶ But my emotional self gets deep gratification from these things, and my aspirational self is telling the story that I am a top notch ladies man and excellent gambler. Then I&rsquo;m not likely to be successful, I haven&rsquo;t brought those parts along.</p><p>Nearly universally, we see religious organizations codify abstinence from sex to the greatest extent possible when joining, can anyone tell me why?</p><p><strong>THALIAN</strong>: Is it because sex is too gratifying and is biologically equivalent to ultimate success?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Close, the church doesn&rsquo;t want you to kill the sexual urge; It wants you to reassign it. It wants you to assign your sexual urges to more fervently serve the church. To use a very powerful driver of behavior to service this new way of life, the churches &ldquo;body&rdquo;. This is why nuns marry Jesus, and are considered holy. This is why priests are supposed to be celibate entirely. And this is why ultimately most cults seek to harness the sexual drive toward the leader.</p><p>The task is hard. Nearly impossible, especially since the context for these choices has been almost entirely lost. But, in the early church, where the shared context was well understood - it was easier.</p><p>Is anyone here aware of the concept of &ldquo;contemplation&rdquo; in the early catholic tradition?</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: It&rsquo;s the idea of being aware of the divine through intuition almost, seeing God. It&rsquo;s kind of an offshoot, in modern times, though.</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: It&rsquo;s usually achieved with prayer or meditation.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, in practice it is a deeply almost erotic act. It is sitting, full attention to God, and allowing yourself to be completely enraptured by it. But the energy used for that complete mind and body vibe was sexual in nature. Not bodily, but mentally. Another way to describe this, because we don&rsquo;t have a context in modern western society was¬†<em>tantric</em>.</p><p>It is the assignation of the sexual part of yourself to more fully appreciate the communion with presence. Making love to the universe, in other words, with your psyche. The church understood, the acts a person must undertake that result in presence are difficult, and can be occasionally quite boring. This is why peter, in his letters to the early church, tell the members to abstain if they can, but if not, to only have one sexual partner. The boring quality of marital sex was considered a feature, not a bug.</p><p><strong>BERO</strong>: But not to confuse it tantric is from Hinduism not Christianity which you are saying is the church?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I am saying the word tantric because we don&rsquo;t have a western word for it. It is simply assigning your sexual self and your sexual energy to the act of being present.</p><p><strong>BERO</strong>: Just don‚Äôt want to get that confused when people say church I assume they‚Äôre referring to Christianity.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I am referring to the early christian church in most cases because that is the font of most of our remaining western nam-shubs. If I were speaking to an islamic audience, I would be using early islam. The point I&rsquo;m currently trying to get across is this. Being present is hard it can be scary. The early church knew this, and sought, through ritualized behavior, social reinforcement, and tantra, to incentivize all parts of oneself to align on that goal. This is why the incense, the arcane language, the mortification, the sexual denial, the regular meetings, even the architecture all serve to deliver a person to this state.</p><p>A state of grace.</p><p>Or, as we would call it now, a state of presence. This is the goal. When they they say the path is narrow, they mean the path to presence, when they say god, they mean &ldquo;what is&rdquo; which you can only witness if you are present. What I&rsquo;ve been doing in here over and over again is to allow you to let go of this idea that early religions were stupid. They were not. But as the early context was lost. We replaced the original meaning of the ideas which are ineffable because they are off the map with concrete concepts. God went from all that is to a dude.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Were they mostly all blind men and an elephant?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Exactly. It wasn&rsquo;t that the keepers of the faith were blind. It&rsquo;s that they had to describe ships on the water to people who had never considered the idea of a ship before. Just like I&rsquo;m trying to do in here. They used the context around them to create a narrow path. So that members would be forced to stumble on them.</p><p><strong>THOS</strong>: So you&rsquo;re saying a lot has gotten lost in translation?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: I&rsquo;m saying that even then, there wasn&rsquo;t a translation. And I&rsquo;m saying that now, with the cultural context that they had now lost to history, you&rsquo;re very unlikely to get what they were trying to say.</p><p>We started, originally, with Lilies of the field. To show how much that concept has been lost. Or the fact that not many people alive today know what this hell original sin is all about. So what I&rsquo;m trying to do in here is create a path using a modern context. Same path, new metaphors. So, lets jump on the elephant in the room, that big, rhino-y, almost universally misunderstood word. God. How, in the bible, does god describe himself when he shows up?</p><p><strong>THALIAN</strong>: The Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Almighty.</p><p><strong>ANIATIO</strong>: Father.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Ding to all. So, god comes by and says. Yo, I&rsquo;m everything. And we, 2000 years later, hear it as. You mean a bearded white dude? And from there, any hope of process toward what the church was trying to do is lost. God isn&rsquo;t a personality, or an intelligence, or a person in these ancient traditions. It is quite literally everything, personified. The universe as a relatable&mldr; thing.¬†<em>This is why god doesn&rsquo;t have a voice, or rather, uses the metatron to speak.</em></p><p>The act of prayer is very different now than it was, because we&rsquo;re tangled up in this idea that he is our literal dad, and we need stuff from him. Originally, asking for stuff in prayer was considered very taboo. Asking for stuff in prayer reinforces the wrong idea. Namely, that you need something you don&rsquo;t already inherently possess. Everybody following so far? Because we need this context under us. God is what is, dogma around god is a social construct designed to grease the skids toward an enlightened place. That you cannot be told about, you must experience. This is why the church makes the rest of your life boring. Mortification and self flagellation, ritual, social reinforcement, all pushing new members toward a space where they can become present using as many aspects of yourself as they can.</p><p>The word &ldquo;Father&rdquo; in this case simply means &ldquo;that which I am issued from&rdquo;. Early beliefs thought that life was in semen. The father literally was carrying around your life. This is why the church doesn&rsquo;t like birth control. So, here we are, ready to start interpreting some very old shit.</p><p><strong>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</strong>¬†<em>Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; they kingcome come thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</em></p><p>With this new understanding underneath us, lets parse out some famous religious ornamentation. Let&rsquo;s start with The Lords Prayer. Which is supposed to contain the ENTIRE teaching in a nutshell. The lords prayer is a portable church, in other words. Let&rsquo;s start with the first line: Our Father.</p><p>Our father is a call to orient one&rsquo;s self appropriately. The stressed concept in modern context is &lsquo;father&rsquo;, But the early stress was on &lsquo;our&rsquo;. Jesus drops this line, in the story. To help you know where you stand. You stand, equally, with everyone else. A more clunky way to put this, unpacked, would be something like:</p><p><em>&ldquo;We know that if we do this together, we have a better chance of reinforcing contemplation and enlightenment, we are all equals in this task, and even Jesus is just another one of us&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;And so we all join together to do that, as we turn our contemplation toward all that is, which we are of course a part of&rdquo;</em></p><p><strong>THOS</strong>: So the &ldquo;who&rdquo; that follows is of less importance.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: The who is deeply important, because that who is, by our closest modern approximation, &ldquo;everything&rdquo;. So lets all get together, as equals, to contemplate that which is.</p><p><strong>THOS</strong>: Yes, what I meant to say is the &ldquo;who&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a person.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes. There is no who, only everything. And we&rsquo;re about to get there&mldr;. because.‚Ä¶ &ldquo;Who art in heaven&rdquo;. What is heaven, in the old testament?</p><p><strong>THALIAN</strong>: Garden of Eden.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: Heaven is a state, not a place.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: No, that&rsquo;s presence, again. What is the first thing that is created, after the void?</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Heaven.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes. Again, an incredibly densely packed allegory, genesis is. The first thing that is created is heaven. So for a very brief moment, all that is is simply &ldquo;heaven&rdquo;. Earth is then created, and now we have a concept of time. because we have two things operating relative to one another.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Because of before / after.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes. But God&rsquo;s first thing (God being everything that is) is to convert everything that is from a concept of nothing to something. Now, it&rsquo;s very easy for me to get of track here, because then earth is created and this becomes a shit-show of complexity I&rsquo;m not ready to tackle today.</p><p>But &ldquo;Who art in heaven&rdquo; means: Yo, god is everything, that dwells everywhere.</p><p>How we doing folks? We&rsquo;re getting pretty high concept here.</p><p><em>People respond that they are tracking.</em></p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: Well, I‚Äôd believed that Heaven was a state, not a place.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: It contains both of those. It is all places and all states. It is also all non places. Earth is created to symbolize duality, and the concept of time, but it is in heaven.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: It is all everything.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yeah, that one will explode my brain if I go down that path, so lets take it slow.</p><p><strong>THOS</strong>: Wait, wait. Heaven has no concept of time or does it?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: No, there is no time if all states are included. This goes back to the lesson of time being a lie that represents two objects in relationship to one another.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Heaven contains Earth because it is all encompassing, and exists. Then earth is created, again introducing the arrow of time. But heaven existed if you will outside of time. So it contains earth.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION:</strong>¬†Bang, right in the kisser. So, &ldquo;Who art in heaven&rdquo; means that is everywhere. And we are really, just barely scratching the surface of these two simple lines. Digging into it deeply in a disassociated ego forward state will break you, because, of course, it is designed to. The point is this, with the proper context, this prayer is designed to break your sense of self and cast you into a present awareness state. We&rsquo;re going very easy on it right now, because we&rsquo;ve only just restored enough context to make this nam-shub potent again.</p><p>And for the lurkers, who are just getting into this. This is not a religious channel, and I am not a religious man, I&rsquo;m not peddling Christianity.</p><p>So, lets get back on track. Who art in heaven simply establishes the dwelling place of life. Which is&mldr; literally translated, everything, everywhere, all the time. Now we get to some truly psychedelic shit. &ldquo;Hallowed be thy name&rdquo;. Here is where the juices really start flowing. Can anybody tell me what&rsquo;s weird about the name of God?</p><p><strong>ANGER</strong>: The name never really translates, does it? There‚Äôs never a right term. We can only approach the word.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Exactly. And the name of God is supposed to have all of this power, right? But for some reason it&rsquo;s unutterable. Yahweh is god&rsquo;s nickname. Gods real name is supposed to have indescribable power. There are entire sects who have taken this literally and spend all day trying to figure out gods name. In the Hindu tradition, dying with &ldquo;gods name&rdquo; on your lips is supposed to stop the karmic cycle and give you everlasting life.</p><p><strong>GNODENTA</strong>: In the romance languages, like French, Dieu has a little more meaning when you look at the latin roots. It&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;to shine&rdquo;. But then again, that&rsquo;s not designating a being but rather a sensation or perception.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: BANG. The name of god is everything that is. To be able to speak it means you are one with everything that is. It is unutterable because it is everything.</p><p><strong>THALIAN</strong>: I am that I am.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes. So, to be capable of speaking gods name is to be completely enlightened, or completely present. This is why god isn&rsquo;t named in the prayer. Otherwise it would be quite simple to say Hallowed is the name &ldquo;Jeff&rdquo;.</p><p>So, hallowed. That&rsquo;s the name. That&rsquo;s a name we all really want. That&rsquo;s the goal, man. The name of God. The next few lines are declarative statements, not requests.¬†<em>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done</em>. We aren&rsquo;t asking for these things, we are acknowledging them.¬†<em>On earth as it is in heaven</em>. Again, not requests. Statements. Not, gosh, we really want these things. But damn, we already have these things. How can we see it? Well, I&rsquo;m glad you asked&mldr;. because!¬†<em>Give us this day our daily bread.</em>¬†What, the¬†<em>fuck</em>, does this line mean? We&rsquo;ve talked about bread in here. Specifically the bread called Manna. Manna is an unleavened bread the Jews used to eat. But why daily?</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Manna, nourishment from heaven. Given to the Israelites.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, and what happened when the Jews collected it, instead of trusting that it would show up the next day?</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: It spoiled and was corrupted. So it&rsquo;s needed each day, and supposed to be consumed that day.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, and storing it is a form of original sin. Storing manna means you are trying to judge what will happen. You&rsquo;re forgetting you&rsquo;re the pond. You are not present, you&rsquo;re worried about the future.¬†<em>You&rsquo;re not a lily of the field.</em></p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: The lily doesn&rsquo;t labor. All is provided, by God.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: No, the lily is holy, because it doesn&rsquo;t dwell in a state of dualism. A lily is all that is, it doesn&rsquo;t judge itself separate.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: It exists, it doesn&rsquo;t concern itself with the future?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes. A lily doesn&rsquo;t know that it isn&rsquo;t God. Original sin is simply this: We developed the belief that were were not God, and it kicked us out of the paradise all other things enjoy; the freedom from the fear of death. The everlasting awareness of the present.</p><p>This helps you see that original sin doesn&rsquo;t mean you are bad. It means you are pitiable. And everything, all the time, is trying to get you to step away from that tortured state. Just, go be a lily, man. lift your face to God &ldquo;what is&rdquo; man, don&rsquo;t store manna, man. Give no thought to the morrow, man. The bible is an astrological metaphor, the stars a cast of characters all designed to &ldquo;wash you&rdquo; of dualism.</p><p>The goal is enlightenment. All the literalism destroys the goal, so the bible looks arcane and cruel. And we aren&rsquo;t done&mldr; because:¬†<em>on earth as it is in heaven.</em>¬†Again. Declarative, not pleading. Asserting. On earth as it is in heaven. It&rsquo;s already done, dualism is a lie.</p><p><strong>GRANDIOSITY</strong>: So, dualism is then the involvement in both the present and the future, and the path to enlightenment involves letting go of that involvement in the future.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: And the past.</p><p>Now, we get an interrogative. The first request in the whole damned thing.¬†<em>Lead us not into temptation.</em></p><p><strong>ACTION</strong>: To a degree this connects with the whole food-thing. We were so preoccupied to make sure Aspiration was able to survive later down the line with meals that we did not consider if he was hungry now. We were so preoccupied with hording we didn&rsquo;t just be.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Finally! I get to check that ding off the list: DING.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY</strong>: Speaking of, we should really make sure the list is done so Aspiration can eat.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: The metaphor has accomplished it&rsquo;s goal. I&rsquo;m going to get a sandwich. A few days fast was good for me and serves important things further down the line. But now I&rsquo;m going to eat.</p><p>So. Temptation. Simple. Direct. Don&rsquo;t drag my ass into dualism.¬†<em>Deliver me from evil.</em>¬†Same interrogative. Evil, sin. Original sin. &ldquo;To miss the mark.&rdquo; Evil, the devil. Lucifer. The morning star, luceferian, the illuminated one. It just means knowledge, my dudes.</p><p>Lucifer wasn&rsquo;t cast out, he became dualistic. Lucifer was the most beloved of the angels. The head, Gods favorite. And he was disconnected, or cast out. As a metaphor for the dangers of living in original sin. Of living apart. With judgement, but not wisdom. He&rsquo;s not a bad guy in the story. He&rsquo;s still gods favorite. He endures it because he can.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Like us?</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Yes, Lucifer is an allegory for man. Or rather, the state of man. Headstrong, dualistic, knowledge seeking. Egocentric. And apart from all that is, in fact, singular in being apart.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Our exit from heaven, given our meaning, and subsequent focus on the self, creating dualism.</p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Along with all people, yes. This is why he is known as the &ldquo;great liar&rdquo;. Because he lies, he introduces dualism where it doesn&rsquo;t otherwise exist.</p><p>And that state? Of believing you can be apart from all that is? It&rsquo;s a clever hell.</p><p><em>End story time.</em></p><p>When we&rsquo;re done, my hope is that you will have enough context that nam-shubs will become functional again for you. And when you&rsquo;re anxious, you&rsquo;ll be able to think of a lily, re associate, and calm yourself.</p><p>Because when you understand the context, it gives the power back.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why the bible, and really all religious texts are called &ldquo;living words&rdquo; If you have the underlying thesis down. They can really slap you right in the face.</p><p>Alright, I&rsquo;m out of here. There are a few people right behind me in here, so if you have questions, ask them.</p><p><em>Introspection fields questions in Aspirations absence.</em></p><p><strong>ASPIRATION</strong>: Introspection, when you have time can you field questions?</p><p><strong>PARAMIA</strong>: What does being present mean other than not worrying about the future?</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Absolutely. Okay so‚Ä¶ Present isn&rsquo;t just about the future. It&rsquo;s a description concerning our awareness of who, what, where we are. And really that we think we are individuals but really are part of something else, a connected everything. Present is almost being fully in the moment that exists outside of time, if that makes sense? From my understanding, today&rsquo;s story was designed to teach us the context used when prayers, today in Christianity but other times in other religions, were written.</p><p>Essentially, there is a sort of universal truth and story, that many religions have seen and tried to format into a roadmap for followers. Each may describe it differently, or have different instructions, but beneath them is a story that we too can see. Without the context of what the instructions mean though, they are hard to follow.</p><p><strong>PARAMIA</strong>: Isn&rsquo;t the concept of ego death pretty much what its getting at?</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: I think there&rsquo;s a strong element of that. But, again I could be wrong here, it&rsquo;s also a recognition that we exist, but exist not as a duality. We are not separate; even though ego exist kills self-identity. But you may be more right than I am there, Paramia.</p><p><strong>PARAMIA</strong>: But, again I could be wrong here, it&rsquo;s also a recognition that we exist, but exist not as a duality. We are not separate. Also can you simplify this? I don&rsquo;t exactly understand.</p><p><strong>INTROSPECTION</strong>: Yeah. My interpretation is that we believe we exist in a duality, or perhaps as a duality. We believe we are separate from the whole. Like you were saying with ego-death, there is no self. Self removes us from presence even, in my mind. Duality is a necessary evil me thinks. Plurality, but it&rsquo;s still illusory; the experience is the same teleologically.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/ data-ctx="notes/Book of October/14 The Lords Prayer" data-src=/ class=internal-link>The Web</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://kneecaps.org/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Extant using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://kneecaps.org/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/seraphim_extant>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/7368697661>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
